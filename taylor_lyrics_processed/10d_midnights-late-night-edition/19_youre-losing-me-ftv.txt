You say I dont understand and I say I know you dont
We thought a cure would come through in time now I fear it wont
Remember lookin at this room we loved it cause of the light
Now I just sit in the dark and wonder if its time


Do I throw out everything we built or keep it
Im getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin from the ashes
Mendin all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow


Stop youre losing me
Stop youre losing me
Stop youre losing me
I cant find a pulse
My heart wont start anymore for you
Cause youre losing me


Every mornin I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you cant tell is dyin
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray but you wouldnt admit that we were sick


And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now youre running down the hallway
And you know what they all say
You dont know what you got until its gone


Stop youre losing me
Stop youre losing me
Stop youre losing me
I cant find a pulse
My heart wont start anymore for you
Cause youre losing me
Cause youre losing me
Stop  cause youre losing me


My heart wont start anymore 
My heart wont start anymore 


How long could we be a sad song
Til we were too far gone to bring back to life
I gave you all my best mes my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army frontlines dont you ignore me
Im the best thing at this party 
And I wouldnt marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And Im fading thinkin
Do something babe say something 
Lose something babe risk something 
Choose something babe I got nothing 
To believe unless youre choosing me


Youre losing me
Stop  youre losing me
Stop  youre losing me
I cant find a pulse my heart wont start anymore
