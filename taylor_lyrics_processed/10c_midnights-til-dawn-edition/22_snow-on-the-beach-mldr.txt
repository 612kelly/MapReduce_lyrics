One night a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what couldve been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time cant stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful thanks for asking
Im unglued thanks to you


And its like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But its comin down
No sound its all around


Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow ah ah


This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched aurora borealis green
Ive never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And its fine to fake it til you make it
Til you do til its true


Now its like snow at the beach
Weird but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But its comin down
No sound its all around


Like snow on the beach 
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach 
Like snow ah ah


I  cant  speak afraid to jinx it
I  dont  even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now Im all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing Can it


Are we falling like snow at the beach 
Weird but fuckin beautiful
Flying in a dream 
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible 
But its comin down
No sound its all around


Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach

Like snow ah
But its comin down
No sound its all around

Like snow on the beach
Like snow like snow uhhuh yeah
