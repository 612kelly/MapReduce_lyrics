Karma is that girl like 


Youre talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal but youre relevant
Youre terrified to look down
Cause if you dare youll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
Its comin back around


And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldnt know what I mean


Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing lik a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that


Karma is your chcks boutta bounce 
Karma is the fire in your house 
And she boutta pop up unannounced 
And she never leavin you alone 
Watch her put ya opps on a throne 
Got you wavin pretty white flags feenin for that cash
Thinkin itll save ya now you switchin up your behavior
Its okay baby you aint gotta worry karma never gets lazy
So I keep my head up my bread up I wont let up 
Promise that youll never endeavor with none lesser 
I be draggin that wagon karma is a beauty winning that pageant grrah


Cause karma is my boyfriend 
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that 


Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade but Im still here



Cause karma is the thunder
Rattlin your ground
Karmas on your scent like a bounty hunter
And karmas gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town
Sweet like justice karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit 
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me


Cause karma is my boyfriend 
Karma is a god 
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend 
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is a god 
Karma is my bestie 
Karmas a relaxing thought
Karmas gonna hold you down
