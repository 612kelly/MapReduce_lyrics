Im doing good Im on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop I didnt though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matine
You know the greatest films of all time were never made


I guess you never know never know
And if you wanted me you really shouldve showed
And if you never bleed youre never gonna grow
And its alright now


But we were something dont you think so
Roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one



I have this dream youre doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now


I guess you never know never know
And its another day waking up alone


But we were something dont you think so
Roaring twenties tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It wouldve been you
In my defense I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one


I I I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today


We were something dont you think so
Ros flowing with your chosen family
And it wouldve been sweet
If it couldve been me
In my defense I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it wouldve been fun
If you wouldve been the one
