Our comingofage has come and gone
Suddenly this summer its clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And its just around the corner darlin
Cause it lives in me
No I could never give you peace


But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace


Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends its like Im wasting your honor
And you know that Id swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough
But theres robbers to the east clowns to the west
Id give you my sunshine give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if youre standin with me


But Im a fire and Ill keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think loves for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devils in the details but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace
