Ive been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels now theyre rusting
I didnt know if youd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Couldve followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I dont quite know what to say
But Im here in your doorway


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when Im mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didnt pour the whiskey


I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


At least Im trying


And its hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
Its hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
Youre a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town


And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


At least Im trying
