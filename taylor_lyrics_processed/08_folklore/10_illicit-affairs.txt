Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head keep your eyes down
Tell your friends youre out for a run
Youll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots


And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
Its born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times


Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you dont even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times


And thats the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times


And you wanna scream
Dont call me kid dont call me baby
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I cant see with anyone else
Dont call me kid dont call me baby
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I cant speak with anyone else


And you know damn well
For you I would ruin myself
A million little times
