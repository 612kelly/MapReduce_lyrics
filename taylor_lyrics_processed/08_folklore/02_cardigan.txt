Vintage tee brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing


But I knew you
Dancin in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby kiss it better I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls lose the one
When you are young they assume you know nothing


But I knew you
Playing hideandseek and
Giving me your weekends I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now Im bleedin


Cause I knew you
Steppin on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy I
I knew you
Leavin like a father
Running like water I
And when you are young they assume you know nothing


But I knew youd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew youd haunt all of my whatifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew Id curse you for the longest time
Chasin shadows in the grocery line
I knew youd miss me once the thrill expired
And youd be standin in my front porch light
And I knew youd come back to me
Youd come back to me
And youd come back to me
And youd come back


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someones bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
