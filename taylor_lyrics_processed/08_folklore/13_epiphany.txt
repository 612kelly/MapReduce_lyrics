Keep your helmet keep your life son
Just a flesh wound heres your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
Sir I think hes bleeding out
And some things you just cant speak about


With you I serve with you I fall down down
Watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out


Something med school did not cover
Someones daughter someones mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
Doc I think shes crashing out
And some things you just cant speak about


Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what youve seen


With you I serve with you I fall down down 
Watch you breathe in watch you breathing out out
With you I serve  with you I fall down  down 
Watch you breathe in  watch you breathing out  out 


Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what youve seen
