I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
Ill show you every version of yourself tonight
Ill get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break its in a million pieces


Hush when no one is around my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
Hush I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you


I want you to know
Im a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten


Hush when no one is around my dear
Youll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you
Hush I know they said the end is near
But Im still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels love
Shining just for you


And they called off the circus burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
Im still on that tightrope
Im still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And Im still a believer but I dont know why
Ive never been a natural all I do is try try try
Im still on that trapeze
Im still trying everything to keep you looking at me


Because Im a mirrorball
Im a mirrorball
And Ill show you every version of yourself tonight
