I can see you standing honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin but the jokes not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin all this love out here in the hall


I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Youre not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town now Im in exile seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before


Ooh ooh ooh


I can see you starin honey
Like hes just your understudy
Like youd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second third and hundredth chances
Balancin on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury


I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Im not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now
You were my crown now Im in exile seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
So Im leaving out the side door


So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didnt even hear me out 
You never gave a warning sign 
All this time
I never learned to read your mind 
I couldnt turn things around 
Cause you never gave a warning sign 
So many signs so many signs
You didnt even see the signs


I think Ive seen this film before
And I didnt like the ending
Youre not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now
You were my town now Im in exile seein you out
I think Ive seen this film before
So Im leavin out the side door

So step right out there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didnt even hear me out 
You never gave a warning sign 
All this time
I never learned to read your mind 
I couldnt turn things around 
Cause you never gave a warning sign 
You never gave a warning sign 
 I never learned to read your mind
 I couldnt turn things around 
Cause you never gave a warning sign 
You never gave a warning sign
Ah ah
