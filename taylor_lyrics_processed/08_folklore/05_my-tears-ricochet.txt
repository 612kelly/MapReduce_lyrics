We gather here we line up weepin in a sunlit room
And if Im on fire youll be made of ashes too
Even on my worst day did I deserve babe
All the hell you gave me
Cause I loved you I swear I loved you
Til my dying day


I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And youre the hero flying around saving face
And if Im dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


We gather stones never knowing what theyll mean
Some to throw some to make a diamond ring
You know I didnt want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
Cause when Id fight you used to tell me I was brave
And if Im dead to you why are you at the wake
Cursing my name wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want just not home
And you can aim for my heart go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you 
And when you cant sleep at night 


I didnt have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And youre tossing out blame drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And youre cursing my name wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
