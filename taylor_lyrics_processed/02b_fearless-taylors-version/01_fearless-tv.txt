Theres something bout the way
The street looks when its just rained
Theres a glow off the pavement you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot yeah
Oh yeah


Were driving down the road I wonder if you know
Im trying so hard not to get caught up now
But youre just so cool run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you


And I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless


So baby drive slow til we run out of road in this onehorse town
I wanna stay right here in this passengers seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now capture it remember it


Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless
Oh oh


Well you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake Im not usually this way but
You pull me in and Im a little more brave
Its the first kiss its flawless really something
Its fearless
Oh yeah


Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless
Cause I dont know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first fearless
And I dont know why but with you Id dance
In a storm in my best dress fearless


Oh oh
Ohoh yeah
