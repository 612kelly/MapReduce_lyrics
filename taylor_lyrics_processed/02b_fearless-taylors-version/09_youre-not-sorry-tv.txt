All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
Ive been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And its taken me this long baby but Ive figured you out
And youre thinking well be fine again but not this time around


You dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby like I did before
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh


Youre looking so innocent I might believe you if I didnt know
Couldve loved you all my life if you hadnt left me waiting in the cold
And youve got your share of secrets
And Im tired of being last to know oh
And now youre asking me to listen
Cause its worked each time before


But you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby like I did before
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh


You had me crawling for you honey
And it never wouldve gone away no
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade


So you dont have to call anymore
I wont pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Theres nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that youre sorry
But I dont believe you baby like I did before
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh
Youre not sorry
No no ohoh


No no no no no no no no no no no no
Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh no no no no no no
