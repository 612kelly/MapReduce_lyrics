Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
Im reaching out and I just cant tell you why
Im caught up in you Im caught up in you


Untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And when youre close I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven


Its half full and I wont wait here all day
I know youre saying that youd be here anyway


But youre untouchable burning brighter than the sun
And now that youre close I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side standing next to me
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven


Im caught up in you
Ohoh oh ohoh
But youre untouchable burning brighter than the sun
Now that youre close I feel like coming undone


In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on oh
In the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side standing next to me
You got to come on come on say that well be together
Come on come on little taste of heaven
Oh ohohoh ohohoh oh


And in the middle of the night when Im in this dream
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on come on oh
Come on come on
Come on come on oh oh oh
Its like a million little stars spelling out your name
Theyre spelling out your name oh
