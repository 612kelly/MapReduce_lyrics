Hey I knew Id run into you somewhere
Its been a while I didnt mean to stare
I heard shes nothin like me
Im sure shell make you happy


But dont you dont you
Smile at me and ask me how Ive been
Dont you say youve
Missed me if you dont want me again
You dont know how much I feel I love you still
So why dont you dont you


Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah


Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
Ive tried but thats just somethin I cant do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldnt do this


But dont you dont you
Smile at me and ask me how Ive been
Dont you say youve
Missed me if you dont want me again
You dont know how much I feel I love you still
So why dont you dont you

So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say were still friends

So if I see you again


Dont you  dont you
Smile at me and ask me how Ive been
Dont you  say youve
Missed me if you dont want me again
You dont  know how much I feel I love you still
So why dont you dont you


Ah ah ah ah
Dont you
