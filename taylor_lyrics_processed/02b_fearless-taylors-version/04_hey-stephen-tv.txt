Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm yeah


Hey Stephen I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didnt say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
Ill be the one waiting there even when its cold
Hey Stephen boy you might have me believing
I dont always have to be alone


Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself


Hey Stephen Ive been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
Ive seen it all so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk way you talk way you say my name
Its beautiful wonderful dont you ever change
Hey Stephen why are people always leaving
I think you and I should stay the same


Cause I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself


Theyre dimming the street lights youre perfect for me
Why arent you here tonight
Im waiting alone now so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine shine shine
Hey Stephen I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls well theyre beautiful
But would they write a song for you 


I cant help it if you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself
If you look like an angel
Cant help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic Ive been feeling since I met you
Cant help it if theres no one else
Mmm I cant help myself


Ahuh myself
Mmmmm I cant help myself
I cant help myself
Ohohoh
Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm
