Friends break up friends get married
Strangers get born strangers get buried
Trends change rumors fly through new skies
But Im right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I Im right where you left me


Help Im still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Crosslegged in the dim light
They say What a sad sight
I I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on I I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinnedup hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective but I sat and stared


Right where you left me
You left me no you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me you left me no oh you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever


Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen
Time went on for everybody else she wont know it
Shes still twentythree inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion
Breakups happen every day you dont have to lose it
Shes still twentythree inside her fantasy
And youre sitting in front of me


At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Crosslegged in the dim light everything was just right
I I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on


Help Im still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Crosslegged in the dim light
They say What a sad sight
I I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinnedup hair
Im sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas but Im unaware
Cause Im right where I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I cant bear witness
And its been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong


Im right where
You left me
You left me no oh you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no oh you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
