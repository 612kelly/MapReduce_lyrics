Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special


Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me
Well it has been a year it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying I love you I meant it
Now I know what a fool Ive been
But if you kiss me now I know you would fool me again


Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special


A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God I thought you were someone to rely on
Me I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special


Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

And last Christmas
And this year
It wont be anything like anything like

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
