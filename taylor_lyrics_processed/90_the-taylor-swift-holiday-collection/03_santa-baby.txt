Santa baby slip a sable under the tree for me
I have been an awful good girl Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight


Santa baby a  convertible too light blue
Well I will wait up for you dear Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight yeah


Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list


Santa baby I want a yacht and really that is not a lot
I have been an angel all year Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight


Santa honey there is one more thing I really do need the deed
To a platinum mine Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight


Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffanys
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me


Santa baby forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I do not mean on the phone Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
