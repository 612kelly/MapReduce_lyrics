I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I cant stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like its mine


He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect Im drawing up the plans
Its like Im  nobody understands
No one understands


He got my heartbeat
Skipping down th Avenue
Got that ah I mean
Wanna see whats under that attitude like
I want you bless my soul
And I aint gotta tell him I think he knows
I think he knows


I think he knows
When we get all alone
Ill make myself at home
And hell want me to stay
I think he knows
Hed better lock it down
Or I wont stick around
Cause good ones never wait 


He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect Im drawing up the plans
Hes so obsessed with me and boy I understand
Boy I understand


He got my heartbeat 
Skipping down th Avenue
Got that ah I mean 
Wanna see whats under that attitude like
I want you bless my soul
And I aint gotta tell him I think he knows
I think he knows


I want you bless my
I want you bless my
I want you bless my
I want you bless my soul


Lyrical smile indigo eyes hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks Ill drive
Lyrical smile indigo eyes hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks Ill drive
So where we gonna go
I whisper in the dark
Where we gonna go
I think he knows


He got my heartbeat 
Skipping down th Avenue 
Got that ah I mean 
Wanna see whats under that attitude like 
I want you bless my soul
And I aint gotta tell him I think he knows
I think he knows


I want you bless my
I want you bless my
I want you bless my 
I want you bless my soul 
I want you bless my 
I want you bless my
I want you bless my soul
And I aint gotta tell him I think he knows
