Combat Im ready for combat
I say I dont want that but what if I do
Cause cruelty wins in the movies
Ive got a hundred thrownout speeches I almost said to you


Easy they come easy they go
I jump from the train I ride off alone
I never grew up its getting so old
Help me hold on to you


Ive been the archer Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay


Dark side I search for your dark side
But what if Im alright right right right here
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years


I wake in the night I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you


Ive been the archer Ive been the prey
Screaming who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay



Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me


All the kings horses all the kings men
Couldnt put me together again
Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you


Ive been the archer Ive been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling
But who could stay

Who could stay
Who could stay
Who could stay
You could stay
You could stay


Combat Im ready for combat
