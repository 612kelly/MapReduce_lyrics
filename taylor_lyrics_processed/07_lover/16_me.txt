I promise that youll never find another like me


I know that Im a handful baby uh
I know I never think before I jump
And youre the kind of guy the ladies want

I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And troubles gonna follow where I go



But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll when it comes to a lover
I promise that youll never find another like


Meee oohoohoohooh
Im the only one of me
Baby thats the fun of me
Eeheeheeh oohoohoohooh
Youre the only one of you
Baby thats the fun of you
And I promise that nobodys gonna love you like meee


I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you baby

And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away



Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin in winter I am your summer
Baby doll when it comes to a lover
I promise that youll never find another like


Meee oohoohoohooh
Im the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeheeheeh oohoohoohooh
Youre the only one of you
Baby thats the fun of you
And I promise that nobodys gonna love you like meee


Girl there aint no I in team
But you know there is a me
Strike the band up   
I promise that youll never find another like me
Girl there aint no I in team
But you know there is a me
And you cant spell awesome without me
I promise that youll never find another like


Meee  oohoohoohooh 
Im the only one of me 
Baby thats the fun of me 
Eeheeheeh oohoohoohooh 
Youre the only one of you 
Baby thats the fun of you
And I promise that nobodys gonna love you like meee


Girl there aint no I in team 
But you know there is a me
Im the only one of me 
Baby thats the fun of me

Strike the band up   
You cant spell awesome without me
Youre the only one of you
Baby thats the fun of you
And I promise that nobodys gonna love you like meee
