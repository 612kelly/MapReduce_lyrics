My my my my
My my my my
My my my my
My my my my


Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but its not enough
Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts


I dress to kill my time I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say I dont know
And what once was ours is no ones now
I see you everywhere the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love one for the ages
But if the storys over why am I still writing pages


Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk but its not enough
Cause the morning comes and youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
Its death by a thousand cuts


My heart my hips my body my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now Im searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs our films united we stand
Our country guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paperthin plans
My time my wine my spirit my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didnt take up
Gave you so much but it wasnt enough
But Ill be alright its just a thousand cuts


I get drunk but its not enough
Cause youre not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandeliers still flickering here
Cause I cant pretend its okay when its not
No its not
Its death by a thousand cuts 


Tryna find a part of me that you didnt touch
My body my love my trust 
But it wasnt enough it wasnt enough no no


I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if itll be alright
They say I dont know
