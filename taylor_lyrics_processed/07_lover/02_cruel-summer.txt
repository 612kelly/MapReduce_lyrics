Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it 
Bad bad boy shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it 


Killing me slow out the window
Im always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice angels roll their eyes
What doesnt kill me makes me want you more


And its new the shape of your body
Its blue the feeling Ive got
And its ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
Its cool thats what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
With you


Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
Im not dying 
We say that well just screw it up in these trying times
Were not trying 


So cut the headlights summers a knife
Im always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed youll be the last to know


Oh its new the shape of your body
Its blue the feeling Ive got
And its ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
Its cool thats what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
With you


Im drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar 
Said Im fine but it wasnt true
I dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate 
And I scream For whatever its worth
I love you aint that the worst thing you ever heard
He looks up grinning like a devil


Its new the shape of your body
Its blue the feeling Ive got
And its ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
Its cool thats what I tell em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh whoa oh
Its a cruel summer
With you


Im drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar 
Said Im fine but it wasnt true
I dont wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate 
And I scream For whatever its worth
I love you aint that the worst thing you ever heard
