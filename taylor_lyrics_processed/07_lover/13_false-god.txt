We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said Id die for you
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how Id fly to you


And I cant talk to you when youre like this
Staring out the window like Im not your favorite town
Im New York City
I still do it for you babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When youre led by blind faith blind faith


But we might just get away with it
Religions in your lips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love


I know heavens a thing
I go there when you touch me honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and were begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you


And you cant talk to me when Im like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
Youre the West Village
You still do it for me babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When youre led by blind faith blind faith


But we might just get away with it
Religions in your lips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if its a false god
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love
Wed still worship this love ah


Still worship this love
Even if its a false god
Even if its a false god
Still worship this love
