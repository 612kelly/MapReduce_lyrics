We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
And this is our place we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years


Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home
Youre my my my my lover


We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place we make the call
And Im highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
Ive loved you three summers now honey but I want em all


Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home 
Youre my my my my lover


Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My hearts been borrowed and yours has been blue
Alls well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table Ill save you a seat lover


Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home 
Youre my my my my
Oh youre my my my my
Darling youre my my my my lover
