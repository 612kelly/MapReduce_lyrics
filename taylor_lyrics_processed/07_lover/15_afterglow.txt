I blew things out of proportion now youre blue
Put you in jail for something you didnt do
I pinned your hands behind your back oh
Thought I had reason to attack but no


Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry til it blows up til theres no us
Whyd I have to break what I love so much
Its on your face and Im to blame I need to say


Hey its all me in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do I dont wanna do this to you 
I dont wanna lose I dont wanna lose this with you 
I need to say hey its all me just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow


Its so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight oh


I lived like an island punished you with silence
Went off like sirens just crying
Whyd I have to break what I love so much
Its on your face dont walk away I need to say


Hey its all me in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Im sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do I dont wanna do this to you 
I dont wanna lose I dont wanna lose this with you 
I need to say hey its all me just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow


Tell me that youre still mine
Tell me that well be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that its not my fault
Tell me that Im all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say


Hey its all me in my head
Im the one who burned us down
But its not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I dont wanna do I dont wanna do this to you 
I dont wanna lose I dont wanna lose this with you 
I need to say hey its all me just dont go
Meet me in the afterglow
