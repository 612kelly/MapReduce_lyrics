Ooh
Ooh


School bell rings walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves you give me one
Wanna hang out Yeah sounds like fun
Video games you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents


Its nice to have a friend 
Its nice to have a friend 


Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down no curfew
 questions we tell the truth
Youve been stressed out lately yeah me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand


Its nice to have a friend 
Its nice to have a friend 



Church bells ring carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff call you Babe
Have my back yeah every day
Feels like home stay in bed
The whole weekend


Its nice to have a friend 
Its nice to have a friend 
Its nice to have a friend
