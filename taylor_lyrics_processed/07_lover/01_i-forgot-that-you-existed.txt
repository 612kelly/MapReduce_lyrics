How many days did I spend thinking
Bout how you did me wrong wrong wrong
Lived in the shade you were throwing
Til all of my sunshine was gone gone gone
And I couldnt get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake so yeah
Your name on my lips tonguetied
Free rent living in my mind


But then something happened one magical night


I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isnt love it isnt hate its just indifference
I forgot that you


Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down down down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground ground ground
And I wouldve stuck around for ya
Wouldve fought the whole town so yeah
Wouldve been right there front row
Even if nobody came to your show


But you showed who you are then one magical night


I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isnt love it isnt hate its just indifference
I forgot that you


Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
Its all just a blur


I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me but it didnt
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did I did I did
It isnt hate its just indifference
It isnt love it isnt hate its just indifference
So yeah
