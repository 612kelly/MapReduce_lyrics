You are somebody that I dont know
But youre takin shots at me like its Patrn
And Im just like damn its  AM
Say it in the street thats a knockout
But you say it in a Tweet thats a copout
And Im just like Hey are you okay


And I aint tryna mess with your selfexpression
But Ive learned a lesson that stressin and obsessin bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones


So ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
You need to calm down youre being too loud
And Im just like ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh 
You need to just stop like can you just not step on my gown
You need to calm down


You are somebody that we dont know
But youre comin at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD 
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin that sign mustve taken all night


You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
Cause shade never made anybody less gay


So ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
You need to calm down youre being too loud
And Im just like ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh 
You need to just stop like can you just not step on his gown
You need to calm down


And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down


Ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh
You need to calm down 
Youre being too loud 
And Im just like ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh ohoh 
You need to just stop 
Like can you just not step on our gowns
You need to calm down
