You know I adore you Im crazier for you
Than I was at  lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens marching band playing
Im lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now Im feeling hopeless ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life 


No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days I counted miles
To see you there to see you there
Its been a long time coming but


Its you and me thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes
Its you and me theres nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
Were so sad we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you


My team is losing battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
Im feeling helpless the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then where are the wise men
Darling Im scared 


No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days I counted miles
To see you there to see you there
And now the storm is coming but


Its you and me thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games you win stupid prizes
Its you and me theres nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
Were so sad we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you


And I dont want you to  I dont really wanna 
Cause nobodys gonna  I think you should come home
And I dont want you to  I dont really wanna 
Cause nobodys gonna  I think you should come home
And I dont want you to  I dont really wanna 
Cause nobodys gonna  just thought you should know
And Ill never let you  cause I know this is a 
That someday were gonna 


Its you and me thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl
Oh I just thought you should know 
Its you and me theres nothing like this 
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
Were so sad we paint the town blue 
Voted most likely to run away with you


And I dont want you to  I dont really wanna 
Cause nobodys gonna  I think you should come home
And Ill never let you  cause I know this is a 
That someday were gonna  just thought you should know


Its you and me thats my whole world
They whisper in the hallway Shes a bad bad girl
Shes a bad bad girl
