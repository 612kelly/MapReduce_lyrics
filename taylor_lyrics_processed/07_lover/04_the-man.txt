I would be complex I would be cool
Theyd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you


Id be a fearless leader
Id be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
Whats that like


Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man


Theyd say I hustled put in the work
They wouldnt shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves


And they would toast to me oh let the players play
Id be just like Leo in SaintTropez


Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man
And Im so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man


Whats it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models
And its all good if youre bad
And its okay if youre mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
Id be a bitch not a baller
Theyd paint me out to be bad
So its okay that Im mad


Im so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man 
And Im so sick of them coming at me again 
Cause if I was a man 
Then Id be the man 
Im so sick of running as fast as I can 
Wondering if Id get there quicker if I was a man 
And Im so sick of them coming at me again 
Cause if I was a man  then Id be the man
Id be the man
Id be the man 
Id be the man 
Id be the man 


If I was a man then Id be the man
