The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctors office lighting I didnt tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles each night I pray to you
Desperate people find faith so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you


Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to


I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isnt real
Ill paint the kitchen neon Ill brighten up the sky
I know Ill never get it theres not a day that I wont try
And I say to you


Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to


And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to
What am I supposed to do
If theres no you


This wont go back to normal if it ever was
Its been years of hoping and I keep saying it because
Cause I have to


Oohah
Youll get better
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Youll get better soon
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Soon youll get better
Oohah
Youll get better soon
Cause you have to
