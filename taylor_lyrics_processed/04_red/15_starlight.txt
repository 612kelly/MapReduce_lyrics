I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight
Like were made of starlight


I met Bobby on the boardwalk summer of 
Picked me up late one night at the window
We were  and crazy running wild wild
Cant remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince


And I said Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight


He said Look at you
Worrying so much about things you cant change
Youll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean saying to me
Dont you see the starlight starlight
Dont you dream impossible things


Like Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight


Ooh ooh hes talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing with me
Ooh ooh we could get married
Have ten kids and teach em how to dream




Oh my what a marvelous tune
It was the best night never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing dancing
Like were made of starlight starlight
Like were made of starlight starlight


Like were made of starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams


Dont you see the starlight starlight
Dont you dream impossible things
