I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying This is it Ive had enough cause like
We hadnt seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space 
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear Im gonna change trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say I hate you we break up you call me I love you


Oohoohoohoohooh
We called it off again last night but
Oohoohoohoohooh
This time Im telling you Im telling you


We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever
Getting back together
Like ever


Im really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that Im right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record thats much cooler than mine


Oohoohoohoohooh
You called me up again tonight but
Oohoohoohoohooh
This time Im telling you Im telling you


We  are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
 But we are never ever ever ever
Getting back together


Oohoohoohoohooh 
Oohoohoohoohoohooh 
Oohoohoohoohooh 
Ohohoh


I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say Never say never
Ugh so he calls me up and hes like I still love you
And Im like I just I mean this is exhausting you know
Like we are never getting back together like ever


 We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever  getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever
Getting back together


We 
Getting back together
We 
Getting back together 
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
 But we are never ever ever ever
Getting back together
