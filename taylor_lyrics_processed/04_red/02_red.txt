Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a deadend street
Faster than the wind passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like tryin to change your mind
Once youre already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn so bright
Just before they lose it all


Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone
Forgetting him was like
Tryin to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red




Loving him was red




Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing theres no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


Losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone 
Forgetting him was like
Tryin to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red



Oh red 
Burning red 



Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself its time now gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning it was red


Oh losing him was blue like Id never known
Missing him was dark gray all alone 
Forgetting him was like
Tryin to know somebody you never met
Cause loving him was red


 Yeah yeah red 
Burning red 

And thats why  hes spinning round in my head
Comes back to me  burning red
 Yeah yeah



His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a deadend street
