It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes uhuh uhuh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers uhuh uhuh


Yeah
Were happy free confused and lonely at the same time
Its miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the deadlines
Its time ohoh


I dont know about you but Im feeling 
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You dont know about me but Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were
 


It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids uhuh uhuh

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping


Yeah
Were happy free confused and lonely in the best way
Its miserable and magical oh yeah
Tonights the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
Its time ohoh



I dont know about you but Im feeling 
Everything will be alright  if you keep me next to you
You dont know about me but Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright if 
We just keep dancing like were  
 
 


It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We wont be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Ooh ooh yeah



I dont know about you but Im feeling 
Everything will be alright if  you keep me next to you
You dont know about me but Ill bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like were
 
 
   


It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We wont be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
