I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder bout me


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont I almost do I almost do


I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
Cause each time you reach out theres no reply
I bet it never ever occurred to you
That I cant say hello to you and risk another goodbye


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont I almost do I almost do


Oh we made quite a mess babe
Its probably better off this way
And I confess babe
In my dreams youre touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do


And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I dont I almost do I almost do


I bet this time of night youre still up
I bet youre tired from a long hard week
I bet youre sittin in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I hope
Sometimes you wonder bout me
