Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights you got me alone
You found me you found me you found me
I guess you didnt care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me without me without me


And hes long gone when hes next to me
And I realize the blame is on me


Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground


Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble


No apologies hell never see you cry
Pretends he doesnt know that hes the reason why
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all Ill ever be
And now I see now I see now I see


He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me hey


I knew you were trouble when you walked in 
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been 
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground


Oh ohoh 
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble


And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her or anyone or anything
Yeah


I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places Id never been 
Til you put me down oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in 
So shame on me now 
Flew me to places Id never been 
Now Im lying on the cold hard ground


Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble 
Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble trouble trouble
