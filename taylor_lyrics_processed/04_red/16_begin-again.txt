Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didnt like it when I wore high heels but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didnt get this song but I do I do
Walked in expecting youd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you dont know how nice that is but I do


And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf I watched it begin again


You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you but I do
We tell stories and you dont know why
Im coming off a little shy but I do


But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf I watched it begin again


And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time whats past is past


Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think its strange that you think Im funny cause he never did
Ive been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a caf I watched it begin again


But on a Wednesday in a caf I watched it begin again
