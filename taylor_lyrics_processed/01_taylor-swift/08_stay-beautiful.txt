Coreys eyes are like a jungle
He smiles its like the radio
He whispers songs into my window in words that nobody knows
These pretty girls on every corner
They watch him as hes walking home saying Does he know
Will you ever know


Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful


Corey finds another way to be the highlight of my day
Im taking pictures in my mind so I can save them for a rainy day
Its hard to make a conversation when hes taking my breath away
I should say
Hey by the way


Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my door
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful


If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
Ill never get to hold
At least youll know


Youre beautiful
Every little piece love
And dont you know
Youre really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life will lead you back to my front door
Oh but if it dont
Will you stay
Beautiful beautiful beautiful
Beautiful beautiful beautiful


La la la
Oh oh oh oh
Oh but if it dont
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na na na na na
