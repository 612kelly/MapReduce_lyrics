Its strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles the flowers everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong


You say that youd take it all back given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes


You shouldve said No
You shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word bout what you did with herd
Get back to me 
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself Why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no baby and you might still have me


You can see that Ive been crying
Baby you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same


You say that the past is the past you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said Yes


You shouldve said No
You shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word bout what you did with herd
Get back to me 
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself Why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no baby and you might still have me


I cant resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it
Was she worth this
No no no no no no


You shouldve said No
You shouldve gone home
You shouldve thought twice fore you let it all go
You shouldve known that word bout what you did with herd
Get back to me 
And I shouldve been there in the back of your mind
I shouldnt be asking myself Why
You shouldnt be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You shouldve said no baby and you might still have me
