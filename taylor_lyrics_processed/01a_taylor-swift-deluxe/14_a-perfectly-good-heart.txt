Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart


Maybe I shouldve seen the signs
Shouldve read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say I still cant believe
That you would walk away
It dont make sense to me but


Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart


Its not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before


Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break Why would you wanna break it
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart now
Why would you wanna make the very first scar
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart
