Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
What I want and I need
And everything that we should be


Ill bet shes beautiful
That girl he talks about
And shes got everything
That I have to live without


Drew talks to me
I laugh cause its just so funny
But I cant even see
Anyone when hes with me


He says hes so in love
Hes finally got it right
I wonder if he knows
Hes all I think about at night


Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do


Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I cant breathe
And there he goes so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


She better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes
And know shes lucky cause


Hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do


So I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
Ill put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight


Cause hes the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one whos got enough of me to break my heart
Hes the song in the car I keep singing
Dont know why I do


Hes the time taken up but theres never enough
And hes all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he wont see
