I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or dont do
Youre so much older and wiser and I


I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it


I greet you with a battle heros welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
Youre so much older and wiser and I


I wait by the door like Im just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it


While you were out building other worlds where was I
Wheres that man whod throw blankets over my barbed wire
I made you my temple my mural my sky
Now Im begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume Im fine but what would you do if I


Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me I could do it
If its all in my head tell me now
Tell me Ive got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it


I sit and watch you
