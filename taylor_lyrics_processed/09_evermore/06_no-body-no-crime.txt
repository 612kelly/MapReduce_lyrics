He did it
He did it


Estes a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Estes been losin sleep
Her husbands actin different and it smells like infidelity
She says That aint my Merlot on his mouth
That aint my jewelry on our joint account
No there aint no doubt
I think Im gonna call him out


She says I think he did it but I just cant prove it
I think he did it but I just cant prove it
I think he did it but I just cant prove it
No no body no crime
But I aint lettin up until the day I die


No no
I think he did it
No no
He did it


Este wasnt there Tuesday night at Olive Garden
At her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Estes bed and everything
No there aint no doubt
Somebodys gotta catch him out cause


I think he did it but I just cant prove it 
I think he did it but I just cant prove it 
I think he did it but I just cant prove it
No no body no crime
But I aint lettin up until the day I die


No no
I think he did it
No no
He did it


Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And Ive cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Estes sisters gonna swear she was with me

Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy


They think she did it but they just cant prove it
They think she did it but they just cant prove it
She thinks I did it but she just cant prove it


No no body no crime
I wasnt lettin up until the day he
No no body no crime
I wasnt lettin up until the day he
No no body no crime
I wasnt lettin up until the day he died
