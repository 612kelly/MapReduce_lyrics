Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind


And if I didnt know better
Id think you were talking to me now
If I didnt know better
Id think you were still around


What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive in my head
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive so alive


Never be so polite
You forget your power
Never wield such power
You forget to be polite


And if I didnt know better
Id think you were listening to me now
If I didnt know better
Id think you were still around


What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive in my head
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive so alive


The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
Youd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I shouldve asked you questions
I shouldve asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Shouldve kept every grocery store receipt
Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me


What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive in my head
What died didnt stay dead
What died didnt stay dead
Youre alive so alive


And if I didnt know better
Id think you were singing to me now
If I didnt know better
Id think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But youre still around
