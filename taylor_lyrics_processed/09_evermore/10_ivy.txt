Hows one to know
Id meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faithforgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand


And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I dont I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living


Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but its been promised to another
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you


I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
Hes in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants whats only yours


Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but its been promised to another
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered


Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose the time is near
What would he do if he found us out
Crescent moon coast is clear
Spring breaks loose but so does fear
Hes gonna burn this house to the ground
Hows one to know
Id live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what well become
And drink my husbands wine


Oh goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine but its been promised to another
Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered in you
And Im covered in you


So yeah its a fire
Its a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah its a war
Its the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it


Oh I cant
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone your ivy grows
And now Im covered
In you in you
Now Im covered in you
In you
