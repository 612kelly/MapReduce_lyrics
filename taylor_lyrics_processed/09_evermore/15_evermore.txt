Gray November
Ive been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire


And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore


Hey December
Guess Im feeling unmoored
Cant remember
What I used to fight for
I rewind the tape but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be doublecrossed


And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore



Cant not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh can we just get a pause
To be certain well be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
Im on waves out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross


And when I was shipwrecked 
I thought of you 
In the cracks of light 
I dreamed of you 
It was real enough 
To get me through 



I swear 
You were there


And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldnt be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldnt be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldnt be for evermore
Evermore
