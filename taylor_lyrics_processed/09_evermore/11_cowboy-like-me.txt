And the tennis court was covered up
With some tentlike thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said Dancin is a dangerous game


Oh I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
Im never gonna love again


Ive got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me


Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now Im waiting by the phone
Like Im sitting in an airport bar


You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me


Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
Youre a bandit like me


Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought Id meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know Ill pay for it


Youre a cowboy like me


Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
Youre a bandit like me


Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought Id meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know Ill pay for it


And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that Ive swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down


Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con


Ive had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
Youre a cowboy like me


And Im never gonna love again
Im never gonna love again
Im never gonna love again
