Hey Dorothea do you ever stop and think about me
When we were younger down in the park
Honey making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screens the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya


Ooh this place is the same as it ever was
Ooh but you wont like it that way


Its never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if youre ever tired of being known for who you know
You know that youll always know me Dorothea 
Dorothea 


Ooh youre a queen sellin dreams sellin makeup and magazines
Ooh from you Id buy anything


Hey Dorothea do you ever stop and think about me
When it was calmer skipping the prom just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
And damn Dorothea they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers Well


Ooh I guess Ill never know
Ooh and youll go on with the show


But its never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
And if youre ever tired of being known for who you know
You know youll always know me Dorothea 
Dorothea 


Ooh ooh
