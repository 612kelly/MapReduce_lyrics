Gleaming twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting I almost jump in


But I dont like a gold rush gold rush
I dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush
I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past quick brush
I dont like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I dont like a gold rush


What must it be like to grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles tshirt hanging from the door


At dinner parties I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we wandered round had never seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my dayold tea
Cause it could never be


Cause I dont like a gold rush gold rush
I dont like anticipatin my face in a red flush
I dont like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past quick brush
I dont like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I dont like that falling feels like flying til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I dont like a gold rush


What must it be like to grow up that beautiful
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I cant dare to dream about you anymore


At dinner parties I wont call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
Cause it fades into the gray of my dayold tea
Cause it will never be


Gleaming twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
So inviting I almost jump in
