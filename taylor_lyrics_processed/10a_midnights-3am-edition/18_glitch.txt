We were supposed to be just friends
You dont live in my part of town but maybe Ill see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship Im in
And whats in my system


I think theres been a glitch ahyeah
Five seconds later Im fastenin myself to you with a stitch ahyeah
And Im not even sorry nights are so starry blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think theres been a glitch uhyeah
Uhhuh uh


I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone elses playground
But its been twothousand onehundred and ninety days of our love blackout

The systems breaking down



I think theres been a glitch ahyeah
Five seconds later Im fastenin myself to you with a stitch ahyeah
And Im not even sorry nights are so starry blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think theres been a glitch uhyeah
Uhhuh uh


A brief interruption a slight malfunction
Id go back to wanting dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And thats romance lets dance


Glitch ahyeah
Five seconds later Im fastenin myself to you with a stitch ahyeah
And Im not even sorry nights are so starry blood moon lit 
It must be counterfeit 
I think theres been a glitch uhyeah
Uhhuh uh
