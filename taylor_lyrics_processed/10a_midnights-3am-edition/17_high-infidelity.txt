Lock broken slur spoken
Wound open game token
I didnt know you were keeping count
Rain soaking blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didnt know you were keeping count


High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around dancing around it


Do you really want to know where I was April th
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes


Storm coming good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely good money
Id pay if youd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time


You know theres many different ways
That you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
Do you really want to know where I was April th
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life


High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around dancing around it


Do you really want to know where I was April th
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes
You know theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough


High infidelity
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around dancing around it


Ooh ooh ooh
Woo woo woo
Woo
Ooh ooh ohh
Woo woo woo
Yeah theres many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And its never enough its never enough


Lock broken slur spoken
Wound open game token
I didnt know you were keeping count
Rain soaking blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didnt know you were keeping count
But oh you were keeping count
