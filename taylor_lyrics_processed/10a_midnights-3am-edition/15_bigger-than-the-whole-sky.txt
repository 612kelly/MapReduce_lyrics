No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
Cause its all over now all out to sea


Goodbye goodbye goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been you


Did some bird flap its wings ovr in Asia
Did some force take you bcause I didnt pray
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
Cause its all over its not meant to be
So Ill say words I dont believe


Goodbye goodbye goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you


What couldve been wouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you
What couldve been wouldve been you



Goodbye goodbye goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And Ive got a lot to pine about
Ive got a lot to live without
Im never gonna meet
What couldve been wouldve been
What shouldve been you
