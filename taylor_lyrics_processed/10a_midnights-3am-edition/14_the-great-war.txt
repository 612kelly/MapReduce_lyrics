My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down took the battle underground
And maybe it was ego swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur


All that blood shed crimson clover
Uhhuh sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uhhuh tears on the ltter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If w survived the Great War


You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire you were playing with fire
And maybe its the past thats talking
Screaming from a crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it


All that blood shed crimson clover
Uhhuh the bombs were close and
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uhhuh the burning embers
I vowed not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War


Uhhuh uhhuh


It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze got a sense Id been betrayed
Your finger on my hair pin triggers
Hold you down on that icy ground looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue so I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I lost you


We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer place a poppy in my hair
Theres no morning glory it was war it wasnt fair
And we will never go back


To that bloodshed crimson clover
Uhhuh the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember
Uhhuh we burn for better
I vowed I would always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War


Uhhuh uhhuh
I would always be yours
Cause we survived the Great War
Uhhuh
I vowed I would always be yours
