If you wouldve blinked then I wouldve looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison you couldve spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint did it splatter on a promising grown man
And if I was a child did it matter if you got to wash your hands


Ooh ooh ooh
All I used to do was pray
Wouldve couldve shouldve
If you never looked my way
I wouldve stayed on my knees


And I damn sure wouldve never danced with the devil
At  and the Gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know I wish you left me wondering


If you never touched me I wouldve gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed then they couldve never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom I couldve gone on as I was
But lord you made me feel important and then you tried to erase us


Ooh ooh ooh
Youre a crisis of my faith
Wouldve couldve shouldve
If Id only played it safe
I wouldve stayed on my knees


And I damn sure wouldve never danced with the devil
At  and the Gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know I wish you left me wondering


God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time


If claritys in death then why wont this die
Years of tearing down our banners you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood it was mine first


And I damn sure wouldve never danced with the devil
At  and the Gods honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that Im grown Im scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know I wish you left me wondering


God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
Oh God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb wont close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I cant let this go I fight with you in my sleep
The wound wont close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
