Once I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now I fear I have fallen from grace


And I feel like my castles crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you dont want to know me I will just let you down
You dont wanna know me now


Once I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge til it tore me apart


Power went to my head and I couldnt stop
Ones I loved tried to help so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept


And I feel like my castles crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you dont want to know me I will just let you down
You dont wanna know me now


My foes and friends watch my reign end
I dont know how it couldve ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like Im a monster
Now theyre screamin at the palaces front gates
Used to chant my name
Now theyre screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me


My castles crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you dont want to know me I will just let you down 
My castles crumbling down
You dont wanna know me now now
