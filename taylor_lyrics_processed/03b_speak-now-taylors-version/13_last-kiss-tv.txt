I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me so why did you go away
Away


I do recall now the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement I ran off the plane
That July ninth the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt I can still feel your arms


But now Ill go
Sit on the floor wearin your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be somethin you miss


I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips


I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party youre showin off again
And Id roll my eyes and then youd pull me in
Im not much for dancin but for you I did
Because I love your handshake meetin my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How youd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
Theres not a day I dont miss those rude interruptions


And Ill go
Sit on the floor wearin your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be somethin you miss


I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips mmm


So Ill watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And Ill keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope its nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and its a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind


So Ill go
Sit on the floor wearin your clothes
All that I know is I dont know
How to be somethin you miss


I never thought wed have a last kiss
I never imagined wed end like this
Your name forever the name on my lips


Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last
