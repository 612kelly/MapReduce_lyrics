Just breathe just relax itll be okay
Just an hour til your cars in the driveway
Just the first time ever hangin out with you tonight
Ive got my money on things goin badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire wont burn me
Just one time just one time


All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch mmm


Ive been left in the rain lost and pining
Im tryin hard not to look like Im trying
Cause every time I tried hard for love it fell apart 
Ive gotten used to no one callin my phone
Ive grown accustomed to sleepin alone
Still I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time just one time


All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch mmm


I was thinking just one time 
Maybe the stars align 
And maybe I call you mine
And you wont need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time 
Maybe the moments right 
Its  and I see two headlights


All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin your electric touch 
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life 
And I want you now wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch mmm
