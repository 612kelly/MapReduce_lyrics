There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter faking smiles
Same old tired lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you


Your eyes whispered Have we met
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you


This night is sparklin dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushin all the way home
Ill spnd forever wonderin if you knw
I was enchanted to meet you


The lingering question kept me up
AM who do you love
I wonder til Im wide awake
And now Im pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
Id open up and you would say
Hey it was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


This night is sparklin dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushin all the way home
Ill spend forever wonderin if you knew
This night is flawless dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever wonderin if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waitin on you
Please dont be in love with someone else 
Please dont have somebody waitin on you 


This night is sparklin dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck blushin all the way home
Ill spend forever wonderin if you knew
This night is flawless 
Dont you let it go
Im wonderstruck 
Dancing around all alone
Ill spend forever 
Wonderin if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


Please dont be in love with someone else
Please dont have somebody waitin on you
