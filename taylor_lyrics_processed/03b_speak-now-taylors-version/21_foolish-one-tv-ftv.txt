My cards are on the table yours are in your hand
Chances are tonight youve already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when somethings really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head


And the voices say You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson


Foolish one
Stop checkin your mailbox for confessions of love
That aint never gonna come
You will take the long way you will take the long way down


You know how to keep me waitin
I know how to act like Im fine
Dont know what to call this situation
But I know I cant call you mine
And its delicate but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinkin youll come around
And maybe someday when were older
This is something well laugh about
Over coffee every mornin while youre watching the news


But then the voices say You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson


Foolish one
Stop checkin your mailbox for confessions of love
That aint never gonna come
You will take the long way you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin your mailbox for confessions of love
That aint never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin out


Now Im slidin down the wall with my head in my hands
Sayin How could I not see the signs
Oh you havent written me or called
But goodbye screamin in the silence
And the voices in my head are tellin me why
Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
Ill get your longing glances but shell get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson


Foolish one
Stop checkin your mailbox for confessions of love
That aint never gonna come
You will take the long way you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin your mailbox for confessions of love
That aint never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin out ohoh oh oh


Lalalalala lalalala oh
Lalalalala
Aint never gonna come
Ooh you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sittin round waiting for confessions of love
They aint never gonna come
And thinkin hes the one you shouldve been walkin out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
When all is said and done he just wasnt the one
No he just wasnt the one
