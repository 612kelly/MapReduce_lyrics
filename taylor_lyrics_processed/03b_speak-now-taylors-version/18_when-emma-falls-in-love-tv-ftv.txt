When Emma falls in love she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks its gonna rain
When Emma falls in love I know
That boy will never be the same


Cause shes the kind of book that you cant put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth sometimes I wish I was her


When Emma falls in love its all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein it all these years
When Emma falls apart its when shes alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
Cause when Emma falls in love shes in it for keeps
She wont walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave


And shes the kind of book that you cant put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth sometimes I wish I was her


Well shes so New York when shes in LA
She wont lose herself in love the way that I did
Cause shell call you out shell put you in your place
When Emma falls in love Im learning


Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now hell be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know his whole worlds about to change


Cause shes the kind of book that you cant put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth sometimes I wish I was her


Yeah between me and you sometimes I wish I was her
