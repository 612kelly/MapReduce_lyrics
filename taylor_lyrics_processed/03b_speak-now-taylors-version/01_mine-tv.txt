Ahah ahah
Ahah ahah


You were in college working parttime waitin tables
Left a small town never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin why we bother with love if it never lasts


I say Can you believe it
As were lyin on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes yes I can see it now


Do you remember we were sittin there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine


Flash forward and were takin on the world together
And theres a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why Im guarded
You say well never make my parents mistakes


But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes yes this is what I thought about


Do you remember we were sittin there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
You are the best thing thats ever been mine


Ohoh oh


And I remember that fight AM
As everything was slippin right out of our hands
I ran out cryin and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
Cause thats all Ive ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said Ill never leave you alone


You said I remember how it felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you its like the first time
I fell in love with a careless mans careful daughter
She is the best thing thats ever been mine


Hold on and make it last
Hold on never turn back
 You made a rebel of a careless mans careful daughter
 You are the best thing thats ever been mine


Yes yes do you believe it 
Yes yes were gonna make it now 
Yes yes and I can see it 
Yes yes I can see it now
