I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin a gown shaped like a pastry


This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Spak now


Fond gestures are xchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bridetobe


She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me dont you


Dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said Speak now
Dont say yes run away now 
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow 
Your time is running out
And they said Speak now


Ooh  la
Ooh  ooh


I hear the preacher say
Speak now or forever hold your peace
Theres the silence theres my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But Im only lookin at you


I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl haha


So dont say yes run away now
Ill meet you when youre out
Of the church at the back door
Dont wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said Speak now
And you say Lets run away now 
Ill meet you when Im out
Of my tux at the back door
Baby I didnt say my vows 
So glad you were around
When they said Speak now
