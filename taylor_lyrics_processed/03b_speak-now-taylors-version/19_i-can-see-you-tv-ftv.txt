Uhuh uh uh


You brush past me in the hallway
And you dont think I I I can see ya do ya
Ive been watchin you for ages
And I spend my time tryin not to feel it


But what would you do if I went to touch you now
What would you do if they never found us out
What would you do if we never made a sound


Cause I can see you waitin down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do Baby if you only knew
That I can see you


Uhuh uh uh


And we kept everything professional
But somethings changed its somethin I I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So its best that we move fast and keep quiet
You wont believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait til you see half the things that havent happened yet


But what would you do if I went to touch you now
What would you do if they never found us out
What would you do if we never made a sound


Cause I can see you waitin down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do Baby if you only knew oh oh oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you make me want you even more
What would you do Baby if you only knew
That I can see you


Uhuh uh uh


I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note saying Meet me tonight
Then we kissed and you know I wont ever tell yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself


Uhuh uh uh
Ohoh oh oh


I can see you waitin down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do Baby if you only knew oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you make me want you even more
What would you do Baby if you only knew
That I can see you oh I can see you


Oh I see you I see you baby
I see you
 I see you I see you baby
Oh baby
