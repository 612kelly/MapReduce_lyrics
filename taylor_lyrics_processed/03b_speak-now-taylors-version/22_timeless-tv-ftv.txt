Down the block theres an antique shop
And something in my head said Stop so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said Photos twentyfive cents each
Black and white saw a s bride
And school lovers laughin on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you dont put down
And thats when I called you and its so hard to explain
But in those photos I saw us instead
And somehow I know that you and I wouldve found each other
In another life you still wouldve turned my head even if wd met


On a crowded street in 
And you wer headed off to fight in the war
You still wouldve been mine
We would have been timeless
I wouldve read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God youd be comin home all right
And you wouldve been fine
We would have been timeless
Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So even in a different life you still wouldve been mine
We wouldve been timeless


I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin round
At these precious things that time forgot
Thats when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago they fell in love like we did
And Id die for you in the same way if I first saw your face


In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still wouldve been mine
We would have been timeless
I wouldve read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still wouldve been mine
We wouldve been timeless
Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So even in a different life you still wouldve been mine
We wouldve been timeless


Time breaks down your mind and body
Dont you let it touch your soul
It was like an ageold classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said Hello


In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes theres no proof you just know
Youre always gonna be mine
Were gonna be
Im gonna love you when our hair is turnin gray
Well have a cardboard box of photos of the life weve made
And youll say Oh my we really were timeless


Were gonna be timeless timeless
You still wouldve been mine
We wouldve been
Even if wed met on a crowded street in 
You still wouldve been mine
We wouldve been


Down the block theres an antique shop
And somethin in my head said Stop so I walked in
