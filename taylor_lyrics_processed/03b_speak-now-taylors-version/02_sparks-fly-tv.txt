The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And Im a house of cards
Youre the kind of reckless that should send me runnin
But I kinda know that I wont get far
And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldnt see what I was thinkin of


Drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


My mind forgets to remind me youre a bad idea
You touch me once and its really somethin
You find Im even better than you imagined I would be
Im on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know its no good
And I could wait patiently but I really wish you would


Drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin your eyes on me
Its just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase wont you whisper soft and slow
Im captivated by you baby like a fireworks show


Drop everything now meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk  take away the pain
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes baby as the lights go down
Give me something thatll haunt me when youre not around
Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


And the sparks fly
Oh baby smile
And the sparks fly
