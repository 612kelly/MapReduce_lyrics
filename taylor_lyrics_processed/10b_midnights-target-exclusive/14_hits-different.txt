I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walking on
They say that if its right you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong


Oh my love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different it hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy for me to do
It hits different it hits different cause its you



I used to switch out these Kens Id just ghost
Rip the bandaid off and skip town lik an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never dont cry  at the bar
Yeah my sadness is contagious 
I slur your name til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations


Oh my love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different it hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy for me to do
It hits different it hits different cause its you



I find the artifacts cried over a hat cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence make it make some sense why the wound is still bleeding
You were the one that I loved dont need another metaphor its simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldnt kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world argumentative antithetical dream girl
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door Is it okay Is it you
Or have they come to take me away
To take me away


Oh my love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different  it hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy for me to do
It hits different  it hits different cause its you
Oh my love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by 

Catastrophic blues
Moving on was always easy for me to do
It hits different it hits different cause its you yeah
