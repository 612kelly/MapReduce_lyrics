Summer went away still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently hes gonna notice me
Its okay were the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice youre smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if its your face
I didnt choose this town I dream of getting out
Theres just one who could make me stay
All my days


From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared


Youre on your own kid
You always have been


I see the great escape so long Daisy May
I picked the petals he loves me not
Something different bloomed writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
Ill run away


From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams arent rare


Youre on your own kid
You always have been




From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood sweat and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like Id be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes werent funny I took the money
My friends from home dont know what to say
I looked around in a bloodsoaked gown
And I saw something they cant take away
Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets take the moment and taste it
Youve got no reason to be afraid


Youre on your own kid
Yeah you can face this
Youre on your own kid
You always have been
