You went to a party
I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea
Dont even get me started
Did you get anxious though
On the way home
I guess Ill never ever know
Now that we dont talk


You grew your hair long
You got new icons
And from the outside
It looks like youre tryin lives on
I miss the old ways
You didnt have to change
But I guess I dont have a say
Now that we dont talk


I call my mom she said that it was for the best
Remind myself the mor I gave youd want me less
I cannot b your friend so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost now that we dont talk


What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners long weekends with
Truth is I cant pretend its
Platonic its just ended so


I call my mom she said to get it off my chest 
Remind myself the way you faded til I left 
I cannot be your friend so I pay the price of what I lost 
And what it cost now that we dont talk


I dont have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that Id like to be on a mega yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off now that we dont talk
And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be now that we dont talk
