Once the flight had flown 
With the wilt of the rose 
I slept all alone 
You still wouldnt go


Lets fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maidens bed for somethin greater baby


Was it over when she laid down on your couch
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse
Come here I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passd out baby
Was it over then
And is it over now





Whn you lost control 
Red blood white snow 
Blue dress on a boat 
Your new girl is my clone


And did you think I didnt see you
There were flashin lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh Lord I think about jumpin
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin
And say the one thing Ive been wanting but no


Lets fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later 
If shes got blue eyes I will surmise that youll probably date her 
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor 
You search in every models bed for somethin greater baby


Was it over when she laid down on your couch
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse
Come here I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out baby
Was it over then
And is it over now


Uhhuh

Uhhuh


Think I didnt see you
There were flashin lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh Lord I think about jumpin
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin 
And say the one thing Ive been wanting but no


Flashin lights oh Lord 
Lets fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later 
 I was hoping youd be there
And say the one thing 
Ive been wanting 
But no
