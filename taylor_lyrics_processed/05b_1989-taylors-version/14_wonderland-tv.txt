Flashin lights
And we took a wrong turn
And we fell down a rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
Cause nothings as it seems
And spinning out of control


Didnt they tell us Dont rush into things
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
Havent you heard what becomes of curious minds
Ooh didnt it all seem new and excitin
I felt your arms twistin around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night


We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever eh
We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but nevr better eh h


In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland


So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watchin
And whispers turned to talkin
And talking turned to screams oh


Didnt they tell us Dont rush into things
Didnt you flash your green eyes at me
Didnt you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile
Ooh didnt it all seem new and excitin
I felt your arms twistin around me
Its all fun and games til somebody loses their mind
But darlin


We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever eh
We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better eh eh


In Wonderland eh eh
In Wonderland
In Wonderland woah
In Wonderland


I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for somethin else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end in Wonderland we both went mad
Oh


We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever 
We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it 
And life was never worse but never better 
We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it 
And we pretended it could last forever 
We found Wonderland you and I got lost in it 
And life was never worse but never better
In Wonderland
