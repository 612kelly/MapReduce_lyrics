Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered 
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinkin


Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good



Looking at it now
Last December 
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together 
Ooh your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldnt quite forget
When we decided we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying flying flying
And I remember thinkin


Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet 
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good



Remember when you hit the brakes too soon
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying baby I did too
But when the sun came up I was lookin at you
Remember when we couldnt take the heat
I walked out I said Im settin you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up you were lookin at me
You were lookin at me oh you were looking at me


I remember


Oh I remember


Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet 
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet 
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet  Are we in the clear yet 
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good 
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good 
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet in the clear yet Good
