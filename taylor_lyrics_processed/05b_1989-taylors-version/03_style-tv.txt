Midnight
You come and pick me up no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burnin flames or paradise
Fade into view oh
Its been a while since I have even heard from you



I should just tell you to leave cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go round and round each time


You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashin down we come back every time
Cause we nver go out of style we nver go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back white tshirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashin down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style


So it goes
He cant keep his wild eyes on the road mmm
Takes me home
Lights are off hes taking off his coat oh yeah
I say I heard oh
That youve been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl


He says What you heard is true but I
Cant stop thinkin bout you and I
I said Ive been there too a few times


Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashin down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back white tshirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt 
And when we go crashin down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style  we never go out of style


Take me home 
Just take me home 
Yeah just take me home 
Woah woah oh 


Oh cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashin down  we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
