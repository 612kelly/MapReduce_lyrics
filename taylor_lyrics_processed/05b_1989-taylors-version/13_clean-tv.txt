The drought was the very worst ahah ahah
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth ahah ahah
Youre still all over me like a winestained dress I cant wear anymore


Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm


The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin thats when I could finally breathe
And by mornin gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean


There was nothin left to do ahah ahah
When the butterflies turnd to dust that covered my whole room
So I punchd a hole in the roof ahah ahah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud but no one heard a thing


The rain came pourin down
When I was drownin thats when I could finally breathe
And by mornin gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean


I think I am finally clean
Ahahahahah
Said I think I am finally clean
Ahahah


Ten months sober I must admit
Just because youre clean dont mean you dont miss it
Ten months older I wont give in
Now that Im clean Im never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst ahah ahah
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst


The rain came pourin down
When I was drownin thats when I could finally breathe
And by mornin gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
The rain came pourin down
When I was drownin thats when I could finally breathe
And by mornin gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean


Finally clean
Think Im finally clean
Ahah ahah
Think Im finally clean
