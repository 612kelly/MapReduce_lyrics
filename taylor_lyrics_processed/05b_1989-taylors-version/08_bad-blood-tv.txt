You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby now we got bad blood hey
Now we got problems
And I dont think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And baby now we got bad blood hey


Did you have to do this
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny Now its all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where Im weak Baby I couldnt breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like youre laughin right at me


Oh its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

Caus baby now we got bad blood hey

Did you think wed be fine
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So dont think its in the past
These kinda wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this wont
So if youre comin my way just dont


Oh its so sad to
