Flamingo pink Sunrise Boulevard
Clink clink being this young is art
Aquamarine moonlit swimmin pool
What if all I need is you


Got lovestruck went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think youll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
Ill pay the price you wont


But if Im all dressed up
They might as well be lookin at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if Im gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love


Send the code hes waitin there
The sticks and stones they throw froze midair
Everyone wants him that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down then hes pullin me in
In a world of boys hes a gentleman


Got lovestruck went straight to my head 
Got lovesick all over my bed 
Love to think youll never forget
Well pay the price I guess


But if Im all dressed up 
They might as well be lookin at us 
And if they call me a slut 
You know it might be worth it for once 
And if Im gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love


Half asleep takin your time
In the tangerine neon light this is luxury
Youre not sayin youre in love with me
But youre going to
Half awake takin your chances
Its a big mistake I said It might blow up in your pretty face
Im not saying Do it anyway 
But youre going to



And if they call me a 
You know it might be worth it for once
And if Im gonna be 
I might as well be drunk in love
