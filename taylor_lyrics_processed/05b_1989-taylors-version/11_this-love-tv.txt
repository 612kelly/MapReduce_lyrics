Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone gone and gone


In silent screams in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this


This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh
Oh oh


Tossing turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby I could go on and on on and on
Lantern burning
Flickered in my mind for only you
But you were still gone gone gone


In losin grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time


This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh








Your kiss my cheek I watched you leave
Your smile my ghost I fell to my knees
When youre young you just run
But you come back to what you need


This love is good this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead oh
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me oh
 This love left a permanent mark
 This love is glowing in the dark oh
 These hands had to let it go free and
 This love came back to me oh





 This love came back to me oh
