Ive known it from the very start
Were a shot in the darkest dark
Oh no oh no Im unarmed
The waiting is a sadness
Fading into madness
Oh no oh no it wont stop


Im standin on a tightrope alone
I hold my breath a little bit longer
Halfway out the door but it wont close
Im holdin out hope for you to


Say Dont go
I would stay forever if you say Dont go


Whyd you have to lead me on
Whyd you have to twist the knife
Walk away and leave me bleedin bleedin
Whyd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night
Now your silence has me screamin screamin


 Say  dont  go
I would stay forevr if you  say  dont  go



Now Im pacin on shaky ground
Strike a match then you blow it out
Oh no oh no its not fair
Cause you kiss m and it stops time
And Im yours but youre not mine
Oh no oh no youre not there


Im standin on the sidewalk alone
I wait for you to drive by
Im tryna see the cards that you wont show
Im about to fold unless you


 Say  dont  go
I would stay forever if you  say  dont  go


Whyd you have to lead me on
Whyd you have to twist the knife
Walk away and leave me bleedin bleedin
Whyd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night
Now your silence has me screamin screamin


 Say  dont  go
I would stay forever if you  say  dont  go woah



Whyd you have to 
Make me want you 
Whyd you have to 
Give me nothin back
Whyd you have to 
Make me love you 
I said I love you 
You say nothin back


Whyd you have to lead me on 
Whyd you have to twist the knife
Walk away and leave me bleedin bleedin
Whyd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night
Now your silence has me screamin screamin


 Say  dont  go
I would stay forever if you  say  dont  go woah


But you wont but you wont but you wont
I would stay forever if you say Dont go
But you wont but you wont but you wont
