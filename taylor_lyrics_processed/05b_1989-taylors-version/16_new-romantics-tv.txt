Were all bored were all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just arent comin
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me mine is better
Were so young but were on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what were doin
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey life is just a classroom
Ahahahahahah


Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And evry day is like a battle
But evry night with us is like a dream
Baby were the new romantics come on come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin to get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free


Were all here the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back its all in the timing
Its poker he cant see it in my face
But Im about to play my Ace ah
We need love but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But honey most of them are true
Ahahahahahah


Cause baby I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby were the new romantics come on come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin  to get knocked off our feet 
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free


 Oh
 So come on come along with me
 The best people in life are free



Please take my hand and
Please take me dancin and
Please leave me stranded
Its so romantic 
Ahahahahahah


Cause baby I could build a castle 
Out of all the bricks they threw at me 
And every day is like a battle 
But every night with us is like a dream 
Cause baby I could build a castle 
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle 
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby were the new romantics come on come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin  to get knocked off our feet
Baby were the new romantics
The best people in life are free
