People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say youve changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road


 Hey all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Hey now you say you want it back
Now that its just too late well couldve been easy
All you had to do was 


All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was stay


Here you are now callin me up
But I dont know what to say
Ive been pickin up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye


 Hey all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Hey now you say you want it back
Now that its just too late well couldve been easy
All you had to do was 


All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 


Let me remind you
This was what you wanted 
You ended it
You were all I wanted 
But not like this
Not like this not like this
Oh all you had to do was


 Hey all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Hey now you say you want it back
Now that its just too late well couldve been easy
All you had to do was
 Hey all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand then
Whyd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in
 Hey now you say you want it back
Now that its just too late well it couldve been easy 
All you had to do was 


 All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was 
All you had to do was
