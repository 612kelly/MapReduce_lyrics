I was born in the arms of imaginary friends
Free to roam made a home out of everywhere Ive been
Then you come crashing in like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring


Oh half of my hearts got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my hearts got a right mind to tell you
That I cant keep loving you 
Oh with half of my heart


I was made to believe Id never love somebody else
Made a plan stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring


Oh half of my hearts got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my hearts got a right mind to tell you
That I cant keep loving you 
Oh with half of my heart


Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I cant stop loving you


I cant stop loving you

But I cant stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart


Half of my hearts got a real cool imagination
Half of my hearts got you
Half of my hearts got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart wont do


Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man whos never truly loved anything
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
Half of my heart
