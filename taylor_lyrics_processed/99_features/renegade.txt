I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay but I stayed anyway
And if I wouldve known how many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay


Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history its time
Youve come a long way open the blinds let me see your face
You wouldnt be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say Get your shit together so I can love you
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything
Or do you just not want to


I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay but I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles cause you hate yourself
But do you know youre demolishing me
And then you squeeze my hand as Im about to leave


Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history its time
Youve come a long way open the blinds let me see your face
You wouldnt be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say Get your shit together so I can love you
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything
Or do you just not want to


And if I wouldve known
How sharp the pieces were youd crumbled into
I mightve let them lay


Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history its time
Youve come a long way open the blinds let me see your face
You wouldnt be the first renegade to need somebody


To need somebody to need somebody to need somebody to need
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history its time
Is it insensitive for me to say Get your shit together so I can love you
You come a long way open the blinds let me see your face
You wouldnt be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything
Or do you just not want to
