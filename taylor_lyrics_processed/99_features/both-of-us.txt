I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us


Uhh
Ever thought about losing it
When your moneys all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge bout  times
But you still cant find no food in it
Thats foolishness
And sometimes I wonder why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost
Does it even really matter
Cause if life is a uphill battle
But yall tryna climb with the same ol ladder
In the same boat with the same ol paddle
Why so shallow Im just askin
Whats the pattern to the madness
Everybody aint a number one draft pick
Most of us aint Hollywood actors
But if its all for one and one for all
Then maybe one day we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours from one of yall


I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us


I could feel your pain I could feel your struggle
You just wanna live but everythings so low
That you could drown in a puddle
Thats why I gotta hold us up yeah hold us up
For all the times no ones ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that thats what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like youre just another person
Getting lost in the crowd way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh because weve both been there both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things thatve molded us
And if life hadnt chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I wouldve wound up
Cause if it was up to me Id make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up hey
But if its all for one and one for all
Then maybe one day we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray to all of yall


I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
