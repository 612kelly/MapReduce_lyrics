I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
Hey you know this could be something
Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now Im left with nothing


So maybe its true that I cant live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But theres so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And youve already got me coming undone
And Im thinking two is better than one


I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everythings okay
Im finally now believing


Then maybe its true that I cant live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But theres so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And youve already got me coming undone
And Im thinking two is better than one
Yeah yeah


I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought hey 


Maybe its true that I cant live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But theres so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And youve already got me coming undone


And Im thinking ooh I cant live without you
Cause baby two is better than one
Theres so much time to figure out the rest of my life
But Ill figure out with all thats said and done
Two is better than one
Two is better than one
