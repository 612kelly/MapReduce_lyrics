The way I woke up was old
Was all fucking choke
And it aint easier after a week
Were on a long byway standing still


Well if you cannot tell Ill tell you right away
If Ill stay a spell or if I cannot stay
I am less at ease not the best at these
See the forest trees call whats these whats these


Whats these 


Hey Madeline thanks
For to case out the fog for Jennifer
Seems she needed you badly


So I beg on knees
Can we share IDs
Will you always need
We have common needs
We can sure deplete
We can be replete
Address table needs
It is swift your speed


The way I wake up now is a brand new way
And no it aint that way like it was before


So I cannot leave
Yes I must here stay
Cause I know whats good
And Ill die that way
No I cannot seem
To get a moments peace
If theres a man like me
His birch aint my tree


The way I woke up now
Is a brand new way
It aint what it was before
