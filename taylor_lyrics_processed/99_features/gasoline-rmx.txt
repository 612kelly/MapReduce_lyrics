You took me back
But you shouldnt have
Now its your fault if I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldnt have
Now Im coughing up like I
Never smoked a pack


Gasoline pretty please
I want to get off
But youre such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat


I get sad you know I get sad
And I cant look past what Im sad about
You did me bad 
And I did it back 
You needed ass well whats
Wrong with that


Gasoline  pretty please 
I want to get off 
But youre such a tease
Throw the keys  back to me 
Go on and kick off your boots 
In the passenger seat


Strike a match strike a match watch it blow
Were watching the sunrise from the kitchen counter
Want you bad want you bad dont you know
When youre lying between my legs it doesnt matter
Strike a match strike a match watch it blow
You say you wanna go slower but I wanna go faster
Want you bad want you bad dont you know
Faster and faster


Gasoline pretty please
I want to get off
But youre such a tease
