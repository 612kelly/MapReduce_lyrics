What a shame
Didnt wanna be the one that got away yeah
Big mistake broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made


Im here on the kitchen floor
You call but I wont hear it
You said No one else how could you do this babe


You really blew this babe
We aint gettin through this one babe
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe
This is the last time this is the last time
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe


What a waste
Takin down the pictures and the plans we made yeah
And its strange how your face doesnt look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and thats on you babe


I break down every time you call
Were a wreck youre the wreckin ball
We said No one else how could you do this babe


You really blew this babe
We aint gettin through this one babe
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe
This is the last time this is the last time
This is the last time


Since you admitted it  I keep picturin 
Her lips on your neck  I cant unsee it 
I hate that because of you  I cant love you babe
What a shame didnt want to be the one that got away
How could you do this babe


You really blew this babe
We aint gettin through this one babe
How could you do this babe
This is the last time this is the last time
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe


How could you do this babe
Im here on the kitchen floor you call but I wont hear it
You said No one else we aint gettin through this one babe
I break down every time you call this is the last time
Were a wreck youre the wreckin ball
This is the last time
You said No one else
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe
