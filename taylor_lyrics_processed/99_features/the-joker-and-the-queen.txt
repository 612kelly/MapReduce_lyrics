How was I to know Its a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be
The road that was broken brought us together


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold you see the best in me
The joker and the queen


Ive been played before if you hadnt guessed
So I kept my cards close to my foolproof vest
But you called my bluff 
And saw through all my tells 
And then you went all in
And we left together


And I know you think that what makes a king
Is gold a palace and diamond rings
When I fold you see the best in me
The joker and the queen




And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen
