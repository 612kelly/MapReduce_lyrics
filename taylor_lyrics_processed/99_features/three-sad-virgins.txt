Another day in the life of Pete
Just sitting in a courtside seat
People wanna take my picture with selfie sticks

All my friends are cool and famous
Except these three sad virgins


Three sad virgins what
Three sad virgins whoa

Characters


Oh so people wont think its about us


Its not about you at all


Their names are Martin Ben and John
And they work at the show Im on
They just dont have any swag

Theyre tall and weird and sad
Johns loud but not very smart
Bens breath kinda smells like a fart
And Martins penis tip is way too red
At least thats what his doctor said


Three sad virgins what

Three sad virgins whoa


Oh my god


Oh that was my real doctor


I gotta say something

Maybe its something topical like Dunes a big movie


Oh something with Dune


A Dune rap


All right all right guys
Its now a Dune rap
So lets get some  sand in here

The planet Dune is very nice
Its a world thats made of spice
Its sandy like a playa

And these guys suck


Three sad virgins what
Three sad virgins on Dune

Damn guys Im sorry I thought that this would be a fun thing for all of us if its not then lets just end it


Thanks Pete


Thank you Pete


I mean after we do the bridge


Wait what bridge


Hey Pete


Oh hey Taylor


Ben is like a sad Ron Weasley
He looks like if Big Bird lost all his feathers
And Martin has the charm and the sex appeal of a scarecrow

John has a bigass bowling ball head
How does he stay upright with that big fat melon
And none of them have the guts to take their shirts off
In front of a girl



Cause theyre three sad virgins what
Three sad virgins whoa
Three sad virgins what
Three sad virgins whoa
Three sad virgins what
Three sad virgins whoa
Three sad virgins what


And theyre gonna die alone
