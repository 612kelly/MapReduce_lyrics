Just feels like the whole thing is, we're all donkeys


Come on in!


Hey, what's up, boys!


Pete in the house

Pete man!


The king of Staten Island himself!


What?


Nothing, what's up?


Well, I just wanna say you guys have been making some really fun videos for the show this year


Dude!


Thank you, man! That's very nice


It got me thinking, like, we should all do a video together. I had this idea where maybe we could do like a music video about how we're all like best friends and how we're all, like, boys


We would be in it with you?


Yeah, you guys would be the boys, so


Yeah! Oh my God!


I would say so, yeah


Let's do it!


Yo, it's Pete and PDD
Let's go


Another day in the life of Pete
Just sitting in a courtside seat
People wanna take my picture with selfie sticks
It winds up on Page Six
It's never-ending
Everyday I'm trending
People wanna see the texts that I'm sending
All my friends are cool and famous
Except these three sad virgins


Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins, whoa
Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins, whoa


Sir, can we time out for a second?


Yeah, what's going on guys? You having fun?


I'm having a blast
Quick question, is this about us?


Which part?


I guess the three sad virgins part


Yeah


Because, like, we have had sex
Maybe not super recently but...


Guys, it's just a parody video, you guys are just playing characters


Characters...


Oh, so people won't think it's about us?


It's not about you at all


Their names are Martin, Ben and John
And they work at the show I'm on
They just don't have any swag
(What?)
They're tall and weird and sad
John's loud but not very smart
Ben's breath kinda smells like a fart
And Martin's penis tip is way too red
At least, that's what his doctor said


Three sad virgins, what?
He's talking about us
Three sad virgins, whoa


Oh my god


Oh, that was my real doctor


I gotta say something


Yeah, you should, yeah


Pete!


What's up?


We love it


Love it


I just had one like tiny thought


This guy has notes? Leave it as-is
It's rocking, dude


Hey, do you have an ashtray by any chance?
Oh yeah, thanks


My only thing is maybe it could just be like completely different


Oh


Oh, okay


Maybe it's something topical, like Dune's a big movie


Oh, something with Dune


A Dune rap


All right, all right guys
It's now a Dune rap
So let's get some -- sand in here!


Yeah


Alright


The planet Dune is very nice
It's a world that's made of spice
It's sandy like a playa
With Zendaya
I'm gonna ride a worm
And these guys suck


Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins on Dune


Why is he humiliating us?
Ben, why are you dressed as Wendy from Wendy's?


Pete made me do it


And why are we up here?


He said we're like the flying sad sacks


You know what? We can't stand for this, right?


Yeah!


Ben! Ben!


Let us down


Hey Ben, you ok, dude?


Are you guys ready to go in again?


No, we can't do this anymore
Okay? It's humiliating


Damn guys, I'm sorry, I thought that this would be a fun thing for all of us, if it's not, then let's just end it


Thanks Pete


Thank you, Pete


I mean, after we do the bridge


Wait, what bridge?


Hey Pete!


Oh, hey Taylor!


Ben is like a sad Ron Weasley
He looks like if Big Bird lost all his feathers
And Martin has the charm and the sex appeal of a scarecrow
(That's not true!)
John has a big-ass bowling ball head
How does he stay upright with that big, fat melon?
And none of them have the guts to take their shirts off
In front of a girl
(Yeah, that's accurate, true)


'Cause they're three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins, whoa
Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins, whoa
Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins, whoa
Three sad virgins, what?


And they're gonna die alone
