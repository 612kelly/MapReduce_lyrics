I get myself twisted in threads
To meet you at The Alcott
Id go to the corner in the back
Where youd always be
And there you are sittin as usual
With your golden notebook
Writing something about someone
Who used to be me


And the last thing you wanted
Is the first thing I do
I tell you my problems
You tell me the truth
Its the last thing you wanted
Its the first thing I do
I tell you that I think Im fallin
Back in love with you


I sit there silently
Waitin for you to look up 
I see you smile
When you see its me
I had to do something
To break into your golden thinking 
How many times will I do this
And youll still believe 


Its the last thing you wanted

Its the first thing you do

You tell me your problems

And I tell you the truth

Its the last thing you wanted

Its the first thing I do

I tell you that I think Im fallin
Back in love with you


And Ill ruin it all over
Ill ruin it for you
Ill ruin it all over
And over like I always do
Ill ruin it all over

Ill ruin it for you

Ill ruin it all over

And over like I always do



Its the last thing I wanted

Its the first thing I do

I tell you my problems

And you tell me the truth

Its the last thing I wanted

Its the first thing I do

I tell you that I think Im fallin
Back in love 
Back in love with you


Back in love with you
