Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me a golden tattoo


All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha ah ah
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah ha ha haah


Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah


Inescapable Im not even gonna try
And if I get burned at least we were electrified
Im spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and were both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about


All of this silence and patience pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha ah ah
All of this silence and patience pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah ha ha haah


Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha


Haahah haahah haahahah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Haahah haahah haahahah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off


Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake I cant explain this
Ah ha ha haah


Say my name and everything just stops
I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I dont want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh ha ha haah


There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
