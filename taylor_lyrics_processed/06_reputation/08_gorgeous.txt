Gorgeous


You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend hes older than us
Hes in the club doin I dont know what
Youre so cool it makes me hate you so much



Whisky on ice Sunset and Vine
Youve ruined my life by not being mine


Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face
Cause look at your face 
And Im so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say
Youre gorgeous


You should take it as a compliment
That Im talking to everyone here but you 
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room 
If youve got a girlfriend Im jealous of her
But if youre single thats honestly worse
Cause youre so gorgeous it actually hurts 


Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die


Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face 
Cause look at your face 
And Im so furious
At you for making me feel this way 
But what can I say
Youre gorgeous


You make me so happy it turns back to sad
Theres nothing I hate more than what I cant have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad 
You make me so happy it turns back to sad 
Theres nothing I hate more than what I cant have and
Guess Ill just stumble on home to my cats  alone
Unless you wanna come along 


Youre so gorgeous
I cant say anything to your face 
Cause look at your face 
And Im so furious 
At you for making me feel this way 
But what can I say 
Youre gorgeous


You make me so happy it turns back to sad 
Theres nothing I hate more than what I cant have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad 
Youre gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad 
Theres nothing I hate more than what I cant have 
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad 
Youre gorgeous
