Dont blame me love made me crazy
If it doesnt you aint doin it right
Lord save me my drug is my baby
Ill be usin for the rest of my life


Ive been breakin hearts a long time
And toyin with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin pacin I just need you


For you I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say Shes gone too far this time


Dont blame me love made me crazy
If it doesnt you aint doin it right
Lord save me my drug is my baby
Ill be usin for the rest of my life
Dont blame me love made me crazy
If it doesnt you aint doin it right
Oh Lord save me my drug is my baby
Ill be usin for the rest of my life


My name is whatever you decide
And Im just gonna call you mine
Im insane but Im your baby 
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy but now Im your daisy


And baby for you I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away Id beg you on my knees to stay


Dont blame me love made me crazy
If it doesnt you aint doin it right
Lord save me my drug is my baby
Ill be usin for the rest of my life
Dont blame me love made me crazy
If it doesnt you aint doin it right
Oh Lord save me my drug is my baby
Ill be usin for the rest of my life


I get so high oh
Every time youre every time youre lovin me
Youre lovin me
Trip of my life oh
Every time youre every time youre touchin me
Youre touchin me
Every time youre every time youre lovin me
Oh Lord save me
My drug is my baby
Ill be usin for the rest of my life



Dont blame me love made me crazy
If it doesnt you aint doin it right 
Lord save me my drug is my baby
Ill be usin for the rest of my life ohoh
Dont blame me love made me crazy 
If it doesnt you aint doin it right 
Oh Lord save me my drug is my baby
Ill be usin for the rest of my life 


I get so high oh
Every time youre every time youre lovin me
Youre lovin me
Oh Lord save me my drug is my baby
Ill be usin for the rest of my life
