No nothing good starts in a getaway car


It was the best of times the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didnt mean it
And you didnt see it
The ties were black the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason


X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well I was lyin to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark 


You were drivin the getaway car
We were flyin but wed never get far
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car ohohoh
No they never get far ohohahh
No nothing good starts in a getaway car


It was the great escape the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you werent thinkin
And I was just drinkin
While he was runnin after us I was screamin Go go go
But with three of us honey its a sideshow
And a circus aint a love story
And now were both sorry 


X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart 


You were drivin the getaway car
We were flyin but wed never get far
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car ohohoh
No they never get far ohohahh
No nothing good starts in a getaway car


We were jetset Bonnie and Clyde 
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
Its no surprise I turned you in 
Cause us traitors never win
Im in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me 


Drivin the getaway car
We were flyin but wed never get far 
Dont pretend its such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart 
Shouldve known Id be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car ohohoh
No they never get far ohohahh
No nothing good starts in a getaway car


I was ridin in a getaway car
I was cryin in a getaway car
I was dyin in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin in a getaway car
I was cryin in a getaway car
I was dyin in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
