Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if hes a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin him for ransom some
Some boys are tryin too hard he dont try at all though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man so
I see nothing better I keep him forever
Like a vendettata


I I I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
IIsland breeze and lights down low
No one has to know


In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know Im gonna be with you so I take my time
Are you ready for it


Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin sorry
But if Im a thief then he can join the heist and
Well move to an island and
And he can be my jailer Burton to this Taylor
Every love Ive known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now Im so very tame now
Never be the same now now


I I I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
IIsland breeze and lights down low
No one has to know 


In the middle of the night in my dreams
You should see the things we do baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know Im gonna be with you so I take my time
Are you ready for it
Oh are you ready for it


Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin


I I I see how this is gon go
Touch me and youll never be alone
IIsland breeze and lights down low
No one has to know


In the middle of the night  in my dreams 
You should see the things we do  baby  hmm 
In the middle of the night in my dreams 
I know Im gonna be with you 
So I take my time
In the middle of the night


Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it
Baby let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it
