Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before but


Dont read the last page
But I stay when youre lost and Im scared and youre turning away
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day


You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that its gonna be a long road
Ill be there if youre the toast of the town babe
Or if you strike out and youre crawling home


Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day


Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you


Please dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please dont ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere


Theres glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore


Dont read the last page
But I stay when its hard or its wrong or were making mistakes
I want your midnights
But Ill be cleaning up bottles with you on New Years Day


Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you


Please dont ever become a stranger

Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

Please dont ever become a stranger

Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
