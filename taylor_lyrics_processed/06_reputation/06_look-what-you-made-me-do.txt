I dont like your little games
Dont like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool no I dont like you
I dont like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isnt cool no I dont like you 


But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
Ive got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once then I check it twice oh


Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


I dont like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast 
The world moves on another day another drama drama
But not for me not for me all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on but one things for sure
Maybe I got mine but youll all get yours


But I got smarter I got harder in the nick of time
Honey I rose up from the dead I do it all the time
Ive got a list of names and yours is in red underlined
I check it once then I check it twice oh


Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I dont trust nobody and nobody trusts me
Ill be the actress starring in your bad dreams
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me
Im sorry the old Taylor cant come to the phone right now
Why Oh cause shes dead 


Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
