It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year


So whyd you have to rain on my parade
Im shaking my head and locking the gates


This is why we cant have nice things darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice things honey 
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have nice things


It was so nice being friends again
There I was giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends dont try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mindtwist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence


But Im not the only friend youve lost lately 
If only you werent so shady


This is why we cant have nice things darling 
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice  things  honey
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have


Heres a toast to my real friends
They dont care about the hesaid shesaid
And heres to my baby
He aint reading what they call me lately
And heres to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And heres to you
Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha I cant even say it with a straight face


This is why we cant have nice things darling 
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we cant have nice  things  honey 
Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have nice things darling

Because you break them
I had to take them

Nice things honey

Did you think I wouldnt hear all the things you said about me
This is why we cant have nice things
