Im perfectly fine I live on my own
I made up my mind Im better off bein alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin me Baby like tryin on clothes


Salute to me Im your American queen
And you move to me like Im a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do


And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once youre all I want Ill never let you go
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa


And all at once Ive been waiting waiting
Ooh whoa ooh whoa
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting waiting
Body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once


Late in the night the citys asleep
Your love is a secret Im hoping dreaming dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury


Salute to me Im your American queen
And you move to me like Im a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room

Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do 


And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once youre all I want Ill never let you go
King of my heart  body and soul ooh whoa


And all at once  Ive been waiting waiting 
Ooh whoa ooh whoa
And all at once you are the one
I have been waiting  waiting 
Body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once


Is this the end of all the endings
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights were spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me not fancy stuff
Baby all at once this is enough


And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once youre all I want Ill never let you go
King of my heart  body and soul  ooh whoa


And all at once Ive been waiting waiting
Ooh whoa ooh whoa
And all at once
Cause youre the one I have been waiting waiting
Body and soul ooh whoa
And all at once
