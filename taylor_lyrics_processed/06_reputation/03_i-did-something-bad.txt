I never trust a narcissist but they love me
So I play em like a violin
And I make it look ohsoeasy
Cause for every lie I tell them they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me


I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit then I owe him nothing
I dont regret it one bit cause he had it coming


They say I did something bad
Then whys it feel so good
They say I did something bad
But whys it feel so good
Most fun I ever had
And Id do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good good

I never trust a playboy but they love me
So I fly em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left


I can feel the flames on my skin
He says Dont throw away a good thing
But if he drops my name then I owe him nothin
And if he spends my change then he had it comin


They say I did something bad 
Then whys it feel so good
They say I did something bad
But whys it feel so good
Most fun I ever had
And Id do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good good

Theyre burning all the witches even if you arent one
They got their pitchforks and proof their receipts and reasons
Theyre burning all the witches even if you arent one
So light me up  light me up 
Light me up go ahead and light me up 
Light me up  light me up 
Light me up  light me up


They say I did something bad 
Then whys it feel so good 
They say I did something bad
But whys it feel so  good
Most fun I ever had 
And Id do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good  good
