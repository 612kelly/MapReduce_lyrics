I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your ATeam 
I wanna be your end game end game


Big reputation big reputation
Ooh you and me we got big reputations ah
And you heard about me ooh
I got some big enemies 
Big reputation big reputation
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation ah 
And I heard about you ooh 
You like the bad ones too


You so dope dont overdose Im so stoked I need a toast
We do the most Im in the Ghost like Im whippin a boat
I got a reputation girl that dont precede me 
Im one call away whenever you need me 
Im in a G  come to the ASide 
I got a bad boy persona thats what they like 
You love it I love it too cause you my type 
You hold me down and I protect you with my life


I dont wanna touch you I dont wanna be
Just another exlove you dont wanna see
I dont wanna miss you 
Like the other girls do
I dont wanna hurt you I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say 
But I aint tryna play


I wanna be your end game 
I wanna be your first string 
I wanna be your ATeam 
I wanna be your end game end game


Knew her when I was young reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me in rumors Im kneedeep
The truth is its easier to ignore it believe me
Even when wed argue wed not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws paranoia and insecurities
Ive made mistakes and made some choices thats hard to deny
After the storm something was born on the th of July
Ive passed days without fun this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue Ill never say it


I dont wanna touch you I dont wanna be
Just another exlove you dont wanna see
I dont wanna miss you 
Like the other girls do
I dont wanna hurt you I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say yeah
But I aint tryna play


I wanna be your end game 
I wanna be your first string 
I wanna be your ATeam 
I wanna be your end game end game


Big reputation big reputation
Ooh you and me we got big reputations ah
And you heard about me ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey big reputation big reputation
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation ah
And I heard about you ooh
You like the bad ones too


I hit you like bang we tried to forget it but we just couldnt
And I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put em
Reputation precedes me they told you Im crazy
I swear I dont love the drama it loves me
And I cant let you go your hand prints on my soul
Its like your eyes are liquor its like your body is gold
Youve been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So heres the truth from my red lips


I wanna be your end game 
I wanna be your first string 
I wanna be your ATeam 
I wanna be your end game end game
I wanna be your end game 
I wanna be your first string 
I wanna be your ATeam 
I wanna be your end game end game
