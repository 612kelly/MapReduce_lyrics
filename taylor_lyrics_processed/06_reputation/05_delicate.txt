This aint for the best
My reputations never been worse so
You must like me for me
We cant make
Any promises now can we babe
But you can make me a drink


Dive bar on the East Side where you at
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes look at you
Oh damn never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
Cause I like you


This aint for the best
My reputations never been worse so
You must like me for me
Yeah I want you
We cant make
Any promises now can we babe
But you can make me a drink


Is it cool that I said all that
Is it chill that youre in my head
Cause I know that its delicate 
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet
Cause I know that its delicate
Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it
Isnt it
Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it
Isnt it delicate


Third floor on the West Side me and you
Handsome youre a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here honey I dont wanna share
Cause I like you


This aint for the best
My reputations never been worse so
You must like me for me
Yeah I want you
We cant make
Any promises now can we babe
But you can make me a drink


Is it cool that I said all that
Is it chill that youre in my head
Cause I know that its delicate 
Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet
Cause I know that its delicate
Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it
Isnt it
Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it
Isnt it delicate


Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend youre mine all the damn time
Cause I like you


Is it cool that I said all that
Is it chill that youre in my head
Cause I know that its delicate 

Is it cool that I said all that
Is it too soon to do this yet
Cause I know that its delicate 
Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that
Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it
Is it chill that youre in my head
Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it
Cause I know that its delicate
Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it

Is it cool that I said all that
Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it
Is it too soon to do this yet
Isnt it Isnt it Isnt it
Cause I know that its delicate
Isnt it delicate
