See you in the dark
All eyes on you my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin triptrippin when youre gone


Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone its so simple
Cause baby I know what you know
We can feel it


And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
Im yours to keep
And Im yours to lose
You know Im not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes


Met you in a bar
All eyes on me your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your gray days clear
And wear you like a necklace
Im so chill but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin skipskippin when Im gone


Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone its so simple
Cause baby I know what you know
We can feel it


And all the pieces fall right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
Im yours to keep
And Im yours to lose
You know Im not a bad girl but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes


Come here dressed in black now
So so so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So so so it goes


You did a number on me
But honestly baby whos counting
I did a number on you
But honestly baby whos counting
You did a number on me
But honestly baby whos counting
Whos counting 


And all the pieces fall right into place 
Getting caught up in a moment 
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
Im yours to keep 
And Im yours to lose 
You know Im not a bad girl but I
I do bad things with you
So it goes


Come here dressed in black now
So so so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So so so it goes
Come here dressed in black now
So so so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So so so it goes
