I I loved you in secret
First sight yeah we love without reason
Oh twentyfive years old
Oh how were you to know And
My my love had been frozen
Deep blue but you painted me golden
Oh and you held me close
Oh how was I to know I


Couldve spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling


But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Yeah we were dancing
Like it was the first time first time
Yeah we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Yeah we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing


I I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So baby can we dance
Oh through an avalanche And
Say say that we got it
Im a mess but Im the mess that you wanted
Oh cause its gravity
Oh keeping you with me I


Couldve spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling


But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Yeah we were dancing
Like it was the first time first time
Yeah we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Yeah we were dancing

And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing


Id kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
Id hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
Id kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
Id hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again 


Dancing with our hands tied hands tied
Oh yeah we were dancing
Like it was the first time first time 
Yeah we were dancing 
Dancing with our hands tied hands tied

Yeah we were dancing 
And I had a bad feeling 
But we were dancing



Hands tied hands tied
