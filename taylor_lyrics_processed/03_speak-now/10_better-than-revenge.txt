Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha time for a little revenge


The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along got him alone and lets hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say Sabotage
I never saw it coming wouldnt have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from


Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress whoa
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress whoa
Soon shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge ha


She looks at life like its a party and shes on the list
She looks at me like Im a trend and shes so over it
I think her everpresent frown is a little troubling
And she thinks Im psycho cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isnt what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh they didnt teach you that in prep school so its up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity



Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress whoa
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress whoa
Soon shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge ha


Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but havent you heard
Im just another thing for you to roll your eyes at honey
You might have him but I always get the last word
Whoa whoaahoh


Shes not a saint and shes not what you think
Shes an actress whoa 
Shes better known for the things that she does
On the mattress whoa
Soon shes gonna find stealing other peoples toys
On the playground wont make you many friends
She should keep in mind she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge ha


Do you still feel like you know what youre doing
Cause I dont think you do oh 
Do you still feel like you know what youre doing 
I dont think you do I dont think you do
Lets hear the applause 
Come on show me how much better you are

See you deserve some applause
Cause youre so much better
She took him faster than you could say Sabotage
