Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
Im not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better


And right before your eyes
Im breaking no past
No reasons why
Just you and me


This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye


You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better


And right before your eyes
Im aching run fast
Nowhere to hide
Just you and me


This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye eye eye




This is the last time you tell me Ive got it wrong
This is the last time I say its been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time I wont hurt you anymore
Ohho ohho ohho ohho
Ohho ohho ohho ohho


This is the last time Im asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time Im asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye


This is the last time Im asking you this

Put my name at the top of your list

This is the last time Im asking you why

You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
This is the last time Im asking you last time Im asking you
Last time Im asking you this
