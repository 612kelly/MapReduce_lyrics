They tell you while youre young
Girls go out and have your fun
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When youre soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say She looks like shes been through it
Lord what will become of me
Once Ive lost my novelty


Ive had too much to drink tonight
And I know its sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
Its like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twentytwo
And will you still want me when Im nothing new


How long will it be cute all this crying in my room
When you cant blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only buying time til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room
People love an ingnue


Ive had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down
And I wake up in the middle of the night
Its like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twentytwo
And will you still want me when Im nothing new


I know someday Im gonna meet her
Its a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
Shell know the way and then shell say she got the map from me
Ill say Im happy for her then Ill cry myself to sleep
Oh woah oh woah oh oh


Ive had  too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if theyll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up  in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twentytwo
And will you still want me will you still want me
Will you still want me when Im nothing new
