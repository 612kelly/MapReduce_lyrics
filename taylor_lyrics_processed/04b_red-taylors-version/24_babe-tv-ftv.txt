What about your promises promises
What about your promises promises promises 


What a shame
Didnt wanna be the one that got away yeah
Big mistake you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made


Im here on the kitchen floor
You call but I wont hear it
You said No one else
How could you do this babe 


You really blew this babe
We aint getting through this one babe
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe 
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe



What a waste
Takin down the pictures and the plans we made yeah
And its strange how your face doesnt look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and thats on you babe


I break down every time you call
Were a wreck youre the wrecking ball
We said No one else
How could you do this babe 


You really blew this babe
We aint getting through this one babe
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe 
This is the last time Ill ever call you


Since you admitted it I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck I cant unsee it
I hate that because of you I cant love you babe
What a shame didnt want to be the one that got away
How could you do this babe


You really blew this babe
We aint getting through this one babe
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe 
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe


Im here on the kitchen floor you call but I wont hear it
You said No one else
We aint getting through this one babe
I break down every time you call
Were a wreck youre the wrecking ball
You said No one else
This is the last time Ill ever call you babe
