I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now
Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days


And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay but Im not fine at all
Oh oh oh


Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the teeball team
You taught me bout your past thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys fuck the patriarchy
Key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down any time now
Hes gonna say its love you never called it what it was
Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing its the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame


And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and wed swear
To remember it all too well yeah


Well maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all


They say alls well that ends well but Im in a new Hell
Every time you doublecross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me who was she
A neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened you
Thats what happened you
You who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes
Sipping coffee like youre on a latenight show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night willing you to come
And he said Its supposed to be fun turning twentyone


Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well yeah
Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known


It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
You remember it all
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well


And I was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
Ill get older but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
Im a soldier whos returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
Just between us did the love affair maim you too
Cause in this citys barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well


Just between us did the love affair maim you all too well
Just between us do you remember it all too well
Just between us I remember it  all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it
Wind in my hair I was there I was there
Down the stairs I was there I was there
Sacred prayer I was there I was there
It was rare you remember it
