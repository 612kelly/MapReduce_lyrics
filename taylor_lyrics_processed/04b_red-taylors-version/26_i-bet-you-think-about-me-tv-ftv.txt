 AM and Im still awake Ill bet youre just fine
Fast asleep in your city thats better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And Ill bet your friends tell you shes better than me huh


Well I tried to fit in with your uppercrust circles
Yeah they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh they sit around talkin about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved em that I hadnt heard of


But now that were done and its over
I bet you couldnt believe
When you realized Im harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me


You grew up in a silverspoon gated community
Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm no it wasnt a mansion
Just livin room dancin and kitchen table bills


But you know what they say you cant help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in you said were too different
You laughed at my dreams rolled your eyes at my jokes


Mr Superior Thinkin
Do you have all the space that you need
I dont have to be your shrink to know that youll never be happy
And I bet you think about me


I bet you think about me yes
I bet you think about me


Oh block it all out
The voices so loud sayin
Why did you let her go
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that youre lookin for
Is the love that you had


Now youre out in the world searchin for your soul
Scared not to be hip scared to get old
Chasing makebelieve status last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered cause you were with me


But now that were done and its over
I bet its hard to believe
That it turned out Im harder to forget than I was to leave
And yeah I bet you think about me


I bet you think about me yes
I bet you think about me


I bet you think about me when youre out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your milliondollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
Oh my god shes insane she wrote a song about me
I bet you think about me
