I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
Id write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


And so it goes
Every weekend the same party
I never go alone
And I dont seem broken hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything Im going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
Cause they dont know about the night in the hotel
They werent riding in the car when we both fell
Didnt read the note on the Polaroid picture
They dont know how much I miss you


I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didnt know
We were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo
Then we broke each others hearts
But dont forget about the night out in LA
Dance in the kitchen chase me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whisper
No one knows how much I miss you


I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you


I remember the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car when we both fell
Im the one on the phone as you whisper
Do you know how much I miss you


I wish that we could go back in time
And Id say to you
I miss you like it was the very first night


I wish I could fly
Id pick you up and wed go back in time
I write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
Take me away
Take me away
Take me away
To you to you
