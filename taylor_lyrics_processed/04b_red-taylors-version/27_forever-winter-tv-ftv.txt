He says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days
He says Why fall in love just so you can watch it go away
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call just checking up on him
Hes up  AM pacing
He says Its not just a phase Im in
My voice comes out begging


All this time I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go


He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out its hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death hell decide to leave instead
I call just checking up on him
Hes up  AM wasted
Long gone not even listening
My voice comes out screaming


All this time I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go


If I was standing there in your apartment
Id take that bomb in your head and disarm it
Id say I love you even at your darkest and
Please dont go


I didnt know
You were breaking down
Id fall to pieces on the floor
If you werent around
Too young to know it gets better
Ill be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go


Ill be your summer sun forever
At  AM pacing
All this time I didnt know
At  AM wasted
Id be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go


He says he doesnt believe anything much he hears these days
I say Believe in one thing I wont go away
