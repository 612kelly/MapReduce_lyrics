One two three four


Give me the keys Ill bring the car back around
We shouldnt be in this town
And my socalled friends they dont know
Id drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and dont say no no
Theres a chain round your throat piece of paper where I wrote
Ill wait for you
Theres a key on the chain theres a picture in a frame
Take it with you


And run like youd run from the law
Darling lets run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is run
Ooh well run
Ooh well run
Ooh well run


So you laugh like a child
And Ill sing like no one cares
No one to be no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and dont say no no
And the note from the locket you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
Theres a heart on your sleeve
Ill take it when I leave
And hold it for you


And run like youd run from the law
Darling lets run
Run from it all
We can go like theyre trying to chase us
Go where no one else is run
Ooh well run
Ooh well run
Ooh well run


Theres been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say youll never let em tear us apart
And Ill hold onto you while we run 


Like youd run from the law 
Darling lets run 
Run from it all 
We can go where our eyes can take us 
Go where no one else is run 
Ooh well run 
Ooh well run 
Ooh well run 
Ooh and well run
