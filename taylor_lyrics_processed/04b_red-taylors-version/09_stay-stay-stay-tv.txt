Im pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning I said we should talk about it
Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
Thats when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said Okay lets talk
And I said


Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay


Before you Id only dated selfindulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now Im always laughing
And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay stay stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didnt leave its been occurring to me
Id like to hang out with you for my whole life


Stay and Ill be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad mad mad
So I think that its best if we both stay stay
Stay stay stay stay


Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay stay
Stay stay stay stay


Stay stay stay
Ive been loving you for quite some time time time
You think that its funny when Im mad mad mad
But I think that its best if we both stay
