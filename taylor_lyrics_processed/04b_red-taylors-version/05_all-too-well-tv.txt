I walked through the door with you the air was cold
But something bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sisters house
And youve still got it in your drawer even now


Oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
Were singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days


And I know its long gone and
That magics not here no more
And I might be okay but Im not fine at all
Oh oh oh


Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red cause you were lookin over at me
Wind in my hair I was there
I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed
And your mothers telling stories bout you on the teeball team
You tell me bout your past thinking your future was me


And I know its long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
Were dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs I was there
I remember it all too well yeah


And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Til you tore it all up
Running scared I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
Im a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
Cause I remember it all all all
Too well


Time wont fly its like Im paralyzed by it
Id like to be my old self again but Im still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You cant get rid of it
Cause you remember it all too well yeah


Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing youve ever known
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well


Wind in my hair you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs you were there
You remember it all
It was rare I was there
I remember it all too well
