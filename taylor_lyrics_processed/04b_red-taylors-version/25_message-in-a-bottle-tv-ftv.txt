I know that you like me
And its kinda frightening standin here waitin waitin
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes tonguetied


But now youre so far away and Im down
Feelin like a face in the crowd
Im reachin for you terrified


Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin here hopin it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep and
I could be the reason you cant sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin here hopin it gets to you


These days Im restless
Workdays are endless look how you made me made me
But time moves faster replaying your laughter disaster


Cause now youre so far away and Im down
Feelin like a face in the crowd
Im reachin for you terrified


Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin here hopin it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep and
I could be the reason you cant sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin here hopin it gets to you


How is it in London
Where were you while Im wondering
If Ill ever see you again
You could be the one that I love mmm
And now Im standin here hopin it gets to you


Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin here hopin it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep and
I could be the reason you cant sleep at night 
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin here hopin it gets to you


You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love I love
And now Im standin here hopin this gets to you
