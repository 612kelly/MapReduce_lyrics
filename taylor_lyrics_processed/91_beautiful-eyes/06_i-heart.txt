Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But its something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what Ive created
I came out alive but Im black and blue


Before you ask me if Im alright
Think about what I
Had to do yeah


Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought youd beat me
Wish you could only see
Ive got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand


Id be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I cant believe you made me
Sit at home and cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night


And now you ask about you and I
Theres no you and I
Remember what you put me through
I had to


Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart put on my makeup
Another mess I didnt plan
And Ill bet you thought youd beat me
Wish you could only see
Ive got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand


And when youre home alone at night
Youll still wonder why
You took everything I had oh baby
I havent thought about you and I
Theres no you and I
And I know
Someday you will


Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we wont make up
It didnt go the way you planned
And youll know you didnt beat me
When you look down and see
Ive got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand


Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark yeah
Written on the back of my hand
