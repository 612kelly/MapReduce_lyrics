Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are painting pictures in the sky
And sometimes we dont say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side


And I know everything about you
I dont wanna live without you


Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryna
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you


Just a smalltown boy and girl
Living in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isnt true
And I dont try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do


And you know everything about me
You say that you cant live without me


Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryna
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me when Im with you


When Im with anybody else
Its so hard to be myself
And only you can tell


That Im only up when youre not down
Dont wanna fly if youre still on the ground
Its like no matter what I do
Well you drive me crazy half the time
The other half Im only tryna
Let you know that what I feel is true
And Im only me who I wanna be
Well Im only me when Im with you


With you
Uhhuh yeah
