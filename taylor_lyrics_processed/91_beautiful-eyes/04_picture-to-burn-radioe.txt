State the obvious I didnt get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that Im obsessive and crazy
Thats fine you wont mind if I say
By the way


I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre just another picture to burn


Theres no time for tears
Im just sitting here planning my revenge
Theres nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddys gonna show you how sorry youll be


I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre just another picture to burn


And if youre missing me youd better keep it to yourself
Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health


Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you havent heard
I really really hate that
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
Youre a redneck heartbreak whos really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as Im concerned youre just another picture to burn


Burn burn burn baby burn
Youre just another picture to burn
Baby burn
