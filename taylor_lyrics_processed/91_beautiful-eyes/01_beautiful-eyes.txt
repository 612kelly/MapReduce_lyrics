Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I dont know why I


I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where


Youre here your eyes are looking into mine
So baby make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
Im looking through your
Im looking through your eyes


I wake up Im alive
In only a little while Ill cry
Cause youre my lullaby
So baby come hold me tight cause II


I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where


Youre here your eyes are looking into mine
So baby make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
Im looking through your
Im looking through your eyes


Just as long as youre mine
Ill be your everything tonight
Let me love you kiss you
Oh baby let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes eyes
Beautiful eyes
