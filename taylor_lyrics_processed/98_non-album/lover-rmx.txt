We could leave the Christmas lights up til January
And this is our place we make the rules
And theres a dazzling haze a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you  seconds or  years


Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home
Youre my my my my lover


We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen baby
Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop
Ill sing love songs to you when were eighty
See I finally got you now honey I wont let you fall


Can I go where you go
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home 
Youre my my my my lover


Ladies and gentlemen will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
Look in my eyes they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you
Id go down with the Titanic its true for you lover
And youll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table Ill save you a seat lover 


Can I go where you go 
Can we always be this close
Forever and ever ah
Take me out and take me home 
Youre my my my my
Oh youre my my my my
Darling youre my my my my lover
