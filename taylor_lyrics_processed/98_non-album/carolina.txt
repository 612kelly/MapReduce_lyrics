Oh Carolina creeks running through my veins
Lost I was born lonesome I came
Lonesome Ill always stay
Carolina knows why for years I roam
Free as these birds light as whispers
Carolina knows


And you didnt see me here
No they never did see me here
And shes in my dreams


Into the mist into the clouds
Dont leave
I make a fist Ill make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know


Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indelible scars pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled
Carolina pines wont you cover me
Hide me like robes down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave


And you didnt see me here
Oh they never did see me
And shes in my dreams


Into the mist into the clouds
Dont leave
I make a fist Ill make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know


And you didnt see me here
They never did see me here
No you didnt see me here
They never saw me


Oh Carolina knows why for years theyve said
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liars bed
But the sleep comes fast and Ill meet no ghosts
Its between me the sand and the sea
Carolina knows
