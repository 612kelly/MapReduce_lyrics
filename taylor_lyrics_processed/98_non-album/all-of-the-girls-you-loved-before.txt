When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin with someone
But feelin alone


A heart is drawn around your name
In someones handwriting not mine
Were sneakin out into town
Holdin hands just killin time


Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me baby
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is


All of the girls you loved before 
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every deadend street led you straight to me
Now youre all I need Im so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more


When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town 
Cryin in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now


Secret jokes all alone
No ones home sixteen and wild 
Were breakin up makin up
Leave without sayin goodbye 


And just know that
Its everything that made me
Now I call you baby
Thats why youre so amazing


All of the girls you loved before 
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every deadend street led you straight to me
Now youre all I need Im so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more


Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you theres good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like


The girls you loved before 
Made you the one Ive fallen for
Every deadend street  led you straight to me 
Now youre all I need  Im so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
