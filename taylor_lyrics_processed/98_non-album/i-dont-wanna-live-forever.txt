Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls hoping youd call
Its just a cruel existence like its no point hoping at all


Baby baby I feel crazy
Up all night all night and every day
Give me something oh but you say nothing
What is happening to me


I dont wanna live forever cause I know Ill be living in vain
And I dont wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home


Im sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life


Baby baby I feel crazy
Up all night all night and every day
I gave you something but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me


I dont wanna live forever cause I know Ill be living in vain
And I dont wanna fit  wherever 
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home


Ive been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby baby I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night all night and every day
Ive been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something oh but you say nothing
Now Im in a cab I tell em where your place is
What is happening to me


I dont wanna live forever cause I know Ill be living in vain
And I dont wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home


I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home
