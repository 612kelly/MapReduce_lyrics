I remember tears streaming down your face when I said Ill never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said Dont leave me here alone
But all thats dead and gone and passed tonight


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound


Dont you dare look out your window darlin everythings on fire
The war outside our door keeps ragin on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when th musics gone gone


Just close your yes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound


Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Oh 
Oh 
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Oh
Oh


Just close your eyes
Youll be alright
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound


Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
