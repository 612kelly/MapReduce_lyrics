Everybodys waiting
Everybodys watching
Even when youre sleeping
Keep your eyes open


The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards
Winnin battles with our wooden swords
But now weve stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score





Everybodys waitin for you to break down
Everybodys watchin to see the fallout
Even when youre sleepin sleepin
Keep your eyes open


Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open


So here you are
Two steps ahead and stayin on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought youd make it this far
But turn around 
Oh theyve surrounded you its a showdown 
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got somethin they dont
Yeah you got somethin they dont


You just gotta keep your eyes open
See Taylor Swift Live
Get tickets as low as 


Everybodys waitin for you to break down
Everybodys watchin to see the fallout
Even when youre sleepin sleepin
Keep your eyes open


Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes


Keep your feet ready heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked the night goes dark
Keep your eyes open






Everybodys waitin for you to break down
Everybodys watchin to see the fallout
Even when youre sleepin sleepin
Keep your eyes open


Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
