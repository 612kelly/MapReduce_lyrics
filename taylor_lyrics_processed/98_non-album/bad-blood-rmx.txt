You know it used to be mad love 
So take a look what youve done 
Cause baby now weve got bad blood  hey 


I cant take it back look where Im at 
We was OG like DOC remember that 
My TLC was quite OD ID my facts 
Now POV of you and me similar Iraq
I dont hate you but I hate to critique overrate you
These beats of a dark heart use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you love dont hear no more

And baby now weve got bad blood hey 


Remember when you tried to write me off 
Remember when you thought Id take a loss
Dont you remember You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure remember Oh wait you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars body bumped bruised
Stabbed in the back brimstone fire jumping through
Still all my life I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

BandAids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
You forgive you forget but you never let it go
BandAids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts 
If you love like that blood runs cold
