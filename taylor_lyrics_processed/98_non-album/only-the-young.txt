It keeps me awake the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
Youre screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think theyre right
You were outnumbered this time


But only the young only the young
Only the young only the young
Can run
Can run
So run and run and run


So every day now
You brace for the sound youve only heard on TV
You go to class scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh how quickly they forget


They arent gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They arent gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that its over
But its just begun


Only one thing can save us
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young
Can run


Dont say youre too tired to fight
Its just a matter of time 
Up theres the finish line 
Dont say youre too tired to fight
Its just a matter of time 
Up theres the finish line 


Only the young
Only the young
Only the young
