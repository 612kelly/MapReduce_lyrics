I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said Ill never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said Dont leave me here alone
But all thats dead and gone and passed tonight


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound


Dont you dare look out your window
Darling everythings on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when  musics gone
Gone


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
Youll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound


Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh


Just close your eyes
Youll be alright
Come morning light
You and Ill be safe and sound


Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh
