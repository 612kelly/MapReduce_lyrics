It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinkin the whole time
Breathe in breathe through breathe deep breathe out
Ill be gettin over you my whole life


You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It cant last


Uhoh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around


It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up break free break through break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile


You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that


Uhoh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around
Uhoh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around
Uhoh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around
Uhoh Im fallin in love
Oh no Im fallin in love again
Oh Im fallin in love
I thought the plane was goin down
Howd you turn it right around
