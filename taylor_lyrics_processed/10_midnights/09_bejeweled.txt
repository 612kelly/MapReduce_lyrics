Baby love I think Ive been a little too kind
Didnt notice you walkin all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin someone first only works when youre in their top five
And by the way Im goin out tonight


Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask Do you have a man
I could still say I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
So put m in the basement
Whn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real I polish up real nice


Nice


Baby boy I think Ive been too good of a girl 
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think its time to teach some lessons
I made you my world  have you heard 
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you 
But I miss sparklin 


Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask Do you have a man
I could still say I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
So put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real I polish up real nice


Nice


Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my auras moonstone
Just cause he was high
And we danced all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
Whats a girl gonna do
A diamonds gotta shine


Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer 
And when I meet the band
They ask Do you have a man
I could still say I dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
So put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real  I polish up real nice


And we danced all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
Whats a girl gonna do Whats a girl gonna do
I polish up nice
Best believe Im still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
