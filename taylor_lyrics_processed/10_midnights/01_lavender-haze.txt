Meet me at midnight


Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh you dont ever say too much
And you dont really read into
My melancholia


I been under scrutiny 
You handled it beautifully 
All this shit is new to me 


I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
Im damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze


All they keep asking me 
Is if Im gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see 
Is a onenight or a wife


I find it dizzying 
Theyre bringing up my history 
But you werent even listening 


I feel the lavender haze creepin up on me
Surreal
Im damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze


That lavender haze


Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk 
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk


I feel  the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
Im damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal 
The s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze


Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
The lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
