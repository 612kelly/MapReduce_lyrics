Youre talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal but youre relevant
Youre terrified to look down
Cause if you dare youll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
Its coming back around


And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldnt know what I mean


Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that


Spider boy king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once trick me twice
Dont you know that cash aint the only price
Its coming back around


And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldnt know what I mean


Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that


Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade but Im still here



Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karmas on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karmas gonna track you down
Step by step from town to town
Sweet like justice karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me


Cause karma is my boyfriend 
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend 
Karmas a relaxing thought
Arent you envious that for you its not
Sweet like honey karma is a cat
Purring in my lap cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that


Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god 
Uhhuh mm
Karmas a relaxing thought
