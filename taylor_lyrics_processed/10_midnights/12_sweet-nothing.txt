I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly a pebble
That we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes
Ooh ooh


They said the end is coming
Everyones up to something
I found myself arunning home to your sweet nothings
Outside theyre push and shoving
Youre in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing


On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say What a mind
This happens all the time
Ooh ooh


Caus they said the end is coming
Evryones up to something
I found myself arunning home to your sweet nothings
Outside theyre push and shoving
Youre in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was nothing


Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smoothtalking hucksters out gladhanding each other
And the voices that implore You should be doing more
To you I cant admit that Im just too soft for all of it
Ooh


They said the end is coming
Everyones up to something
I found myself arunning home to your sweet nothings
Outside theyre push and shoving
Youre in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing
They said the end is coming

Everyones up to something

I found myself arunning home to your sweet nothings
Outside theyre push and shoving

Youre in the kitchen humming

All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothing
