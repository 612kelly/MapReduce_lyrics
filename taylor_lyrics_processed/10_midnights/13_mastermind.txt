Once upon a time the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time


And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate I couldnt lose


What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in the line
What if I told you Im a mastermind
And now youre min
It was all by design
Cause Im a mastermind


You see all th wisest women
Had to do it this way
Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lovers game


If you fail to plan you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
Im the wind in our freeflowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails


What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you Im a mastermind
And now youre mine
It was all my design
Cause Im a mastermind


No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So Ive been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time Ive felt the need to confess
And I swear
Im only cryptic and Machiavellian
Cause I care


So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that Im a mastermind
And now youre mine
Yeah all you did was smile
Cause Im a mastermind
