I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift all of the people
Ive ghosted stand there in the room


I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
Cause you got tired of my scheming



Its me hi
Im the problem its me
At teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero


Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And Im a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart but never killed


Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day Ill watch as youre leaving
And life will lose all its meaning



Its me hi
Im the problem its me 
At teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero


I have this dream my daughterinlaw kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers around and reads it
And then someone screams out
Shes laughing up at us from hell


Its me hi
Im the problem its me
Its me hi
Im the problem its me
Its me hi
Everybody agrees everybody agrees


Its me hi 
Im the problem its me 
At teatime  everybody agrees 
Ill stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the antihero
