I remember


Good girl sad boy
Big city wrong choices
We had one thing goin on
I swear that it was somethin
Cause I dont remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color Ive searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin situations circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say by the way
I just may like some explanations


Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin fun of you
But fifteen seconds later thy were clappin too
Then what did you do
Did you lave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
Its just a question


Halfmoon eyes bad surprise
Did you realize out of time
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin
It was one drink after another
Fuckin politics and gender roles
And youre not sure and I dont know
Got swept away in the grey
I just may like to have a conversation


Can I ask you a question
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin too
Then what did you do
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
Its just a question


Does it feel like everythings just like
Second best after that meteor strike
And whats that that I heard That youre still with her
Thats nice Im sure thats whats suitable
And right but tonight


Can I ask you a question 
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room 
And every single one of your friends was makin fun of you 
But fifteen seconds later they were clappin too
Then what did you do 
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night Oh
Did you wish youd put up more of a fight oh 
When she said it was too much
Do you wish you could still touch her
Its just a question
