Say youre sorry that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin on the days drag on
Stupid girl I shoulda known I shoulda known


That Im not a princess this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around


Maybe I was naive got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake I didnt know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings now I know


That Im not a princess this aint a fairytale
Im not the one youll sweep off her feet lead her up the stairwell
This aint Hollywood this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To come around


And there you are on your knees
Beggin for forgiveness beggin for me
Just like I always wanted
But Im so sorry


Cause Im not your princess this aint our fairytale
Im gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And its too late for you and your white horse
Now its too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now


Oh whoa whoa whoa
Try and catch me now oh
Its too late to catch me now
