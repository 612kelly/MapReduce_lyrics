I took a chance I took a shot
And you might think Im bulletproof but Im not
You took a swing I took it hard
And down here from the ground I see who you are


Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you love me then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when youre around
And heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why


You could write a book on how to ruin someones perfect day
Well I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what Im trying to say oh


Im sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when youre around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why


Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So youre the only thing on my mind


Im sick and tired of your attitude
Im feeling like I dont know you
You tell me that you want me then cut me down
Im sick and tired of your reasons
Ive got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love then you push me around
Heres to you and your temper
Yes I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what youre doing to me
Tell me why 
Tell me why 


I take a step back let you go
I told you Im not bulletproof
Now you know
