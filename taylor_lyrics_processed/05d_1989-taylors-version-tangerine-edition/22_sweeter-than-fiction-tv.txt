Hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
Only sound only sound that you hear is No
You never saw it comin slipped when you started runnin
And now youve come undone and I I I I


Seen you fall seen you crawl on your knees eh ayy
Seen you lost in a crowd seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better someday you wont remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever


There youll stand ten feet tall
I will say I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction


Just a shot just a shot in the dark oh oh
All you got all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it comin you hit the ground runnin
And now youre on to somethin I I I say


What a sight what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There youll stand ten feet tall
I will say I knew it all along
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There youll stand next to me 
All at once the rest is history 
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction 


Ill be one of the many sayin
Look at you now look at you now and now
Ill be one of the many saying
Youve made us proud youve made us proud proud
Ill be one of the many sayin
Look at you now look at you now and now
Ill be one of the many sayin
Youve made us proud youve made us proud proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that Ill be there time and again
Cause I loved you when


When you hit the ground hit the ground hit the ground oh oh
Only sound only sound that you heard was No
Now in this perfect weather its like we dont remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever 


There youll stand ten feet tall 
I will say I knew it all along 
Your eyes are wider than distance 
This life is sweeter than fiction 
There youll stand next to me 
All at once the rest is history 
Your eyes are wider than distance 
This life is sweeter than fiction 


Its sweeter than fiction
Its sweeter yeah
Its sweeter its sweeter
Its sweeter than fiction
