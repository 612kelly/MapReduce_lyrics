Cause baby now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love 
So take a look what youve done 
Cause baby now weve got bad blood  hey 


I cant take it back look where Im at 
We was OG like DOC remember that 
My TLC was quite OD ID my facts 
Now POV of you and me similar Iraq
I dont hate you but I hate to critique overrate you
These beats of a dark heart use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you love dont hear no more no I dont fear no more
Better yet respect aint quite sincere no more


Oh its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I


Cause baby now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby now weve got bad blood hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve them 
You made a really deep cut 
And baby now weve got bad blood hey 


Remember when you tried to write me off 
Remember when you thought Id take a loss
Dont you remember You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure remember Oh wait youve got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds battle scars body bumped bruised
Stabbed in the back brimstone fire jumping through
Still all my life I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now 


Oh its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

And I dont think we can solve them 
You made a really deep cut 
And baby now weve got bad blood hey 


Bandaids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
You forgive you forget but you never let it go
Bandaids dont fix bullet holes 
You say sorry just for show 
If you live like that you live with ghosts  mmm
If you love like that blood runs cold
