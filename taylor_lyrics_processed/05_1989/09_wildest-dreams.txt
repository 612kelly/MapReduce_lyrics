He said Lets get out of this town
Drive out of this city away from the crowds
I thought Heaven cant help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down


Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is


Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams ah ha
Wildest dreams ah ha


I said No one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin lasts forever
But this is gettin good now


Hes so tall and handsome as hell
Hes so bad but he does it so well
And when weve had our very last kiss
My last request is


Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your
Wildest dreams ah ha 
Wildest dreams ah ha


Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
Youll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin  it  down 
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow  you  around



Say youll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just pretend


Say youll remember me
Standin in a nice dress
Starin at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say youll see me again
Even if its just in your 
Wildest dreams ah ha 
In your wildest dreams ah ha
Even if its just in your
In your wildest dreams ah ha
In your wildest dreams ah ha
