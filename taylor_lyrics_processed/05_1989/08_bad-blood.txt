Cause baby now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby now weve got bad blood hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now weve got bad blood hey


Did you have to do this
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny
Now its all rusted
Did you have to hit me where Im weak
Baby I couldnt breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like youre laughing right at me


Oh its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I


Cause baby now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby now weve got bad blood hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now weve got bad blood hey


Did you think wed be fine
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So dont think its in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this wont
So if youre coming my way
Just dont


Oh its so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I


Cause baby now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby now weve got bad blood hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em
You made a really deep cut
And baby now weve got bad blood hey


Bandaids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
Bandaids dont fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that you live with ghosts
If you love like that blood runs cold


Cause baby now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done
Cause baby now weve got bad blood hey
Now weve got problems
And I dont think we can solve em 
You made a really deep cut
And baby now weve got bad blood hey


Cause baby now weve got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what youve done 
Cause baby now weve got bad blood hey
