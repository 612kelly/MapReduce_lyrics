Its AM in your car
Windows down you pass my street the memories start
You say its in the past you drive straight ahead
Youre thinking that I hate you now
Cause you still dont know what I never said


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I
Wish you knew that
Id never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would


Its AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane
I think of you
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I
Wish you knew that
Id never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore and I
Wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would


I I I I I I wish I wish I
I I I I I I wish I wish I
I I I I I I wish I wish I


You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would I wish you would

I wish you would I wish you would




AM here we are
See your face hear my voice in the dark
Were a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around


I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I
Wish you knew that
Id never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did I
Wish you knew that
Id never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore and I
Wish you were right here right now its all good
I wish you would



You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would I wish you would

I wish you would I wish you would


I I I I I I wish I wish I
I I I I I I wish I wish I
I wish you would
