The drought was the very worst 
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth 
Youre still all over me
Like a winestained dress I cant wear anymore


Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm


Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean



There was nothing left to do 
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof 
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


The water filled my lungs I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing


Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean

I think I am finally clean

Oh oh oh oh ohoh
Said I think I am finally clean

Oh oh oh oh ohoh


Ten months sober I must admit
Just because youre clean dont mean you dont miss it
Ten months older I wont give in
Now that Im clean Im never gonna risk it


The drought was the very worst 
When the flowers that wed grown together died of thirst



The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning thats when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you I think I am finally clean



Finally clean
Think Im finally clean

Ohoh ohoh

Think Im finally clean
