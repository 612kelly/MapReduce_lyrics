I I I I I I I II
I I I I I I I II
I I I I I I I II 


You stand with your hand on my waistline
Its a scene and were out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
Its a bad sign bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Loves a fragile little flame it could burn out
It could burn out


Cause they got the cages they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes and we run


Baby I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places I know places


Lights flash and well run for the fences
Let them say what they want we wont hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time


Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it my love
They are the hunters we are the foxes and we run


Baby I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places


They are the hunters we are the foxes and we run
Just grab my hand and dont ever drop it my love


Baby I know places we wont be found
And theyll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I I know places we can hide
I know places


They take their shots but were bulletproof 
And you know for me its always you 
In the dead of night your eyes so green 
And I know for you its always me 
I I I I I I I II
I I I I I I I II
