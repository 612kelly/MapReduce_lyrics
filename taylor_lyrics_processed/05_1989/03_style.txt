Midnight
You come and pick me up no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view oh
Its been a while since I have even heard from you

And I should just tell you to leave cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go round and round each time


You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back white tshirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style


So it goes
He cant keep his wild eyes on the road 
Takes me home
The lights are off hes taking off his coat 
I say I heard oh
That youve been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl
He says What you heard is true but I
Cant stop thinking bout you and I
I said Ive been there too a few times


Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back white tshirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

And when we go crashing down we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style 
We never go out of style


Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah just take me home
Ohoh whoaoh oh



Oh you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down 
We come back every time
Cause we never go out of style we never go out of style
