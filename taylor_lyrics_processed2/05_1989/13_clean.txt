drought worst
flowers wed grown together died thirst
months months back forth
Youre still
Like winestained dress cant wear anymore


Hung head lost war
sky turned black like perfect storm


Rain came pouring
drowning thats could finally breathe
morning
Gone trace think finally clean



nothing left
butterflies turned
Dust covered whole room
punched hole roof
Let flood carry away pictures


water filled lungs screamed loud
one heard thing


Rain came pouring
drowning thats could finally breathe
morning
Gone trace think finally clean

think finally clean

Oh oh oh oh ohoh
Said think finally clean

Oh oh oh oh ohoh


Ten months sober must admit
youre clean dont mean dont miss
Ten months older wont give
Im clean Im never gonna risk


drought worst
flowers wed grown together died thirst



rain came pouring
drowning thats could finally breathe
morning
Gone trace think finally clean
Rain came pouring
drowning thats could finally breathe
morning
Gone trace think finally clean



Finally clean
Think Im finally clean

Ohoh ohoh

Think Im finally clean
