Clear blue water
High tide came brought
could go
Skies grew darker
Currents swept
gone gone gone gone


silent screams wildest dreams
never dreamed


love good love bad
love alive back dead ohoh oh
hands let go free
love came back ohoh oh
Ohoh oh ohoh oh


Tossing turning
Struggled night someone new
could go
Lantern burning
Flickered mind
still gone gone gone


losing grip sinking ships
showed time


love good love bad
love alive back dead ohoh oh
hands let go free
love came back ohoh oh
love left permanent mark
love glowing dark ohoh oh
hands let go free
love came back ohoh oh








kiss cheek
watched leave
smile ghost
fell knees
youre young run
come back need


love good love bad
love alive back dead ohoh oh
hands let go free
love came back ohoh oh
love left permanent mark
love glowing dark ohoh oh
hands let go free
love came back ohoh oh





love love came back ohoh oh
