Midnight
come pick headlights
long drive
Could end burning flames paradise
Fade view oh

tell leave cause
Know exactly leads
Watch us go round round time

got red lip classic thing like
go crashing come back every time
Cause never go style never go style
got long hair slicked back white tshirt
got good girl faith tight little skirt
go crashing come back every time
Cause never go style never go style

Takes home

got red lip classic thing like
go crashing come back every time
Cause never go style never go style
got long hair slicked back white tshirt
got good girl faith tight little skirt

Cause never go style

got red lip classic thing like

Cause never go style never go style
