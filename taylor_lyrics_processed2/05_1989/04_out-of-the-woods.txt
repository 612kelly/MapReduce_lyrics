Looking
seems simple
lying couch
remember
took Polaroid us
discovered
rest world black white
screaming color
remember thinking


woods yet woods yet
woods yet woods
clear yet clear yet
clear yet clear yet Good
woods yet woods yet
woods yet woods
clear yet clear yet
clear yet clear yet Good



Looking
Last December
built fall apart
fall back together
Ooh necklace hanging neck
night couldnt quite forget
decided decided
move furniture could dance
Baby like stood chance
Two paper airplanes flying flying flying
remember thinking


woods yet woods yet
woods yet woods
clear yet clear yet
clear yet clear yet Good
woods yet woods yet
woods yet woods
clear yet clear yet
clear yet clear yet Good



Remember hit brakes soon
Twenty stitches hospital room
started crying baby
sun came looking
Remember couldnt take heat
walked said Im setting free
monsters turned trees
sun came looking
looking ooh
looking


remember


Oh remember


woods yet woods yet
woods yet woods
clear yet clear yet
clear yet clear yet Good
woods yet woods yet
woods yet woods
clear yet clear yet
clear yet clear yet Good


woods yet woods yet
woods yet woods
clear yet clear yet
clear yet clear yet Good
woods yet woods yet
woods yet woods
clear yet clear yet
clear yet clear yet Good
