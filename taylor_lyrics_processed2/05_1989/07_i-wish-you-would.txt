car
Windows pass street memories start
say past drive straight ahead
Youre thinking hate
Cause still dont know never said


wish would come back
Wish never hung phone like
Wish knew
Id never forget long live
Wish right right good
wish would


room
Headlights pass window pane
think
crooked love straight line
Makes want run hide
makes turn right back around


wish would come back
Wish never hung phone like
Wish knew
Id never forget long live
Wish right right good
wish would
wish could go back
remember fighting
Wish knew
miss much mad anymore
Wish right right good
wish would


wish wish

always knew push buttons
give everything nothing
mad mad love makes come running
stand back stood
wish would wish would

wish would wish would





See face hear voice dark
crooked love straight line
Makes wanna run hide
made us turn right back around


wish would come back
Wish never hung phone like
Wish knew
Id never forget long live
Wish right right good
wish would
wish would come back
Wish never hung phone like
Wish knew
Id never forget long live
Wish right right good

wish could go back
remember fighting
Wish knew

Wish right right good

always knew push buttons
give everything nothing
mad mad love makes come running
