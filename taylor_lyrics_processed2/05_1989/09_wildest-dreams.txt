said Lets get town
Drive city away crowds
thought Heaven cant help
Nothing lasts forever

Hes tall handsome hell
Hes bad well
see end begins
one condition


Say youll remember
Standin nice dress
Starin sunset babe
Red lips rosy cheeks
Say youll see
Even
Wildest dreams ah ha
Wildest dreams ah ha


said one know
hands hair clothes room
voice familiar sound
Nothin lasts forever
gettin good


Hes tall handsome hell
Hes bad well
weve last kiss
last request


Say youll remember
Standin nice dress
Starin sunset babe
Red lips rosy cheeks
Say youll see
Even
Wildest dreams ah ha
Wildest dreams ah ha


Youll see hindsight
Tangled night
Burnin
Someday leave
bet memories
Follow around
Youll see hindsight
Tangled night
Burnin
Someday leave
bet memories
Follow around



Say youll remember
Standing nice dress
Starin sunset babe
Red lips rosy cheeks
Say youll see
Even pretend


Say youll remember
Standin nice dress
Starin sunset babe
Red lips rosy cheeks
Say youll see
Even
Wildest dreams ah ha

Even
