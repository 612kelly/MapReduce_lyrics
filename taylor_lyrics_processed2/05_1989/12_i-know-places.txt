stand hand waistline
scene plain sight
hear whisper pass
bad sign bad sign
Something happens everybody finds
See vultures circling dark clouds
Loves fragile little flame could burn
could burn


Cause got cages got boxes guns
hunters foxes run


Baby know places wont found
theyll chasing tails trying track us
Cause know places hide
know places know places


Lights flash well run fences
Let say want wont hear
Loose lips sink ships damn time
time


grab hand dont ever drop love
hunters foxes run


Baby know places wont found
theyll chasing tails trying track us
Cause know places hide
know places


hunters foxes run
grab hand dont ever drop love


Baby know places wont found
theyll chasing tails trying track us
Cause know places hide
know places


take shots bulletproof
know always
dead night eyes green
know always
