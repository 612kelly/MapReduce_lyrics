ribbons bows didnt mean thing
Would song still survive without five golden rings
Would still wanna kiss without mistletoe
would happen God never let snow
would happen Christmas carols told lie
Tell would find


Youd see today holds something special
Something holy superficial
heres birthday boy saved lives
something try ignore
put wreath door
heres something know sure
Christmas must something


angels pay attention
things wished would always
happiness came cardboard box
think something forgot
would happen presents went away
Tell would find


Youd see today holds something special
Something holy superficial
heres birthday boy saved lives
something try ignore
put wreath door
heres something know sure
Christmas must something


get caught
Business relationships
Hundredmileanhour lives
time year
everybodys
seems last thing mind


day holds something special
Something holy superficial
heres Jesus Christ saved lives
something try ignore
put wreath door
heres something know sure
Christmas must something
Christmas must something
Christmas must something


Theres gotta
Theres gotta
