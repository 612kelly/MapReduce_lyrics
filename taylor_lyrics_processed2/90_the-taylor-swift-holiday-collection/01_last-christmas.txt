Last Christmas gave heart
next day gave away
year save tears
give someone special


bitten twice shied
keep distance still catch eye
Tell baby
recognize
Well year surprise
Merry Christmas wrapped sent
note saying love meant
know fool Ive
kiss know would fool


Last Christmas gave heart
next day gave away
year save tears
give someone special
Last Christmas gave heart
next day gave away
year save tears
give someone special


crowded room friends tired eyes
hiding soul ice
God thought someone rely
guess shoulder cry
face lover fire heart
girl cover tore apart
Maybe year
Maybe year give someone special


last Christmas gave heart
next day gave away
year save tears
give someone special
Last Christmas gave heart
next day gave away
year save tears
give someone special

last Christmas
year
wont anything like anything like

Last Christmas gave heart
next day gave away
year save tears
give someone special
