Please take mistletoe
Cause dont want think right
Cause everything want miles away
snow covered little town
mommas kitchen worrying
Seasons greetings hope youre well
Well Im alright
wondering
Lately never tell


know shouldnt lonely time
Christmases mine


Ive fine without really
nights got cold
everybodys except baby
Seems like everyones got someone hold


lonely time
Cause Christmases mine


Merry Christmas everybody
Thatll something say year
Ill bet got mom another sweater
cousins late
putting lights year
notice one less pair hands


know shouldnt lonely time
Christmases didnt wonder tonight
Cause Christmases mine


mine
