upon time
believe Tuesday caught eye
caught onto something
hold onto night
looked eye told loved
kidding
Cause seems
thing breaking almost never speak
dont feel welcome anymore
Baby happened Please tell
Cause one second perfect
youre halfway door


stare phone still hasnt called
feel low cant feel nothing
flashback said forever always
Oh rains bedroom everything wrong
rains youre rains youre gone
said forever always


line
say something way honest made run hide
Like scared little boy
looked eyes
Thought knew minute Im sure
heres everything coming nothing
Heres silence cuts core
going
Thought knew minute dont anymore


stare phone still hasnt called
feel low cant feel nothing
flashback said forever always
rains bedroom everything wrong
rains youre rains youre gone
said forever always


didnt mean baby
dont think


Oh ohoh ohohoh
Ohoh ohohoh oh
Back baby back
forget everything
Back baby back
forget everything
Back baby back
Please back oh back
Back baby back


Cause rains bedroom everything wrong
rains youre rains youre gone
said forever always
stare phone still hasnt called
feel low cant feel nothing
flashback said forever always
Cause rains bedroom everything wrong
rains youre rains youre gone
said forever always


didnt mean baby
said forever always yeah
