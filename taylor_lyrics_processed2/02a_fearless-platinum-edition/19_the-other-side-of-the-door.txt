heat fight walked away
Ignoring words saying
Trying make stay
said time Ive enough
youve called hundred times
Im picking


Cause Im mad might tell
look little closer


said Leave really want
stand outside window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im love
Wait pouring rain
Come back
dont leave cause know
need side door


stupid pride sitting alone
Going photographs staring phone
keep going back things said
remember slamming door
things misread


babe know everything
Tell couldnt see
left wanted chase


Yeah said Leave really want
stand outside window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im love
Wait pouring rain
Come back
dont leave cause know
need side door


Ill scream window
cant even look
dont need
say Theres nothing say
make right mean mean
mean


said Leave baby want
stand outside window throwing pebbles
Screaming Im love
Wait pouring rain
Come back
dont leave cause know
need side door


face beautiful eyes
conversation little white lies
faded picture beautiful night
carried car stairs
broke crying worth mess
everything little black dress
everything must confess need
