could go back every laugh
dont wanna go anymore
know steps door
dont wanna go anymore


Talk wind talk sky
Talk man reasons
let know find


Ill leave window open
Cause Im tired night call name
know Im right hoping
youll come rain


could stand sing song
dont wanna go far
Ive got know heart
dont even know start


Talk talk tears
Talk man put
dont wait sky clear


Ill leave window open
Cause Im tired night call name
know Im right hoping
youll come rain


Ive watched long screamed name
dont know else say


Ill leave window open
Cause Im tired night games
know Im right hoping
youll come rain


could go back every laugh
dont wanna go anymore
