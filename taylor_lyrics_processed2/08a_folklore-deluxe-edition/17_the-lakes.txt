romantic elegies eulogize
Im cut cynical clones
hunters cell phones


Take Lakes poets went die
dont belong beloved neither
Windermere peaks look like perfect place cry
Im setting without muse


burrowed skin
heartstopping waves hurt
Ive come far watch namedropping sleaze
Tell words worth


Take Lakes poets went die
dont belong beloved neither
Windermere peaks look like perfect place cry
Im setting without muse


want auroras sad prose
want watch wisteria grow right bare feet
Cause havent moved years
want right
red rose grew ice frozen ground
one around tweet
bathe cliffside pools
calamitous love insurmountable grief


Take Lakes poets went die
dont belong beloved neither
Windermere peaks look like perfect place cry
Im setting without muse
without
