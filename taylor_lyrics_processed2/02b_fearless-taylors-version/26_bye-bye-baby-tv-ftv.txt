wasnt like movie
rain didnt soak clothes skin
Im drivin away guess could say
last time Ill drive way
Lost gray try grab fray
Cause still love cant


Bye bye everything thought side
Bye bye baby
want back come nothing
sympathy
Cause took home couldnt keep
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby


picture frame empty
dresser vacant like
see writing dash
back hesitation
sure everything
Everything thought wed always
Guess never doubted
floods
Feels like Im becoming part past


Bye bye everything thought side
Bye bye baby
want back come nothing
sympathy
Cause took home couldnt keep
Bye bye baby


theres much cant touch
Youre want enough time
pages slipping hands
Im scared ends


Bye bye everything thought side
Bye bye baby
want back come nothing
sympathy
Cause took home couldnt keep


Bye bye everything thought side
Bye bye baby
want back come nothing
sympathy
Cause took home couldnt keep
Oh took home thought gonna keep
Bye bye baby
Bye bye baby
