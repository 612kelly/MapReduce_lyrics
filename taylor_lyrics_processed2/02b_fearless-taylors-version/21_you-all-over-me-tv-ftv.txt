last drop rain dried pavement
Shouldnt find stain never
way tires turn stones old county roads
leave em muddy underneath reminds
find graffiti walls old bathroom stalls
know scratch right used
like dollar pocket spent traded
cant change reminds


lived learned got burned
Held held
God knows long wasted time
Lost tears swore Id get
amount freedom gets clean
Ive still got


best worst day June
one met
hands pockets
Dont wish grin
Well smiled
melted like child
every breath air breathe reminds


lived learned got burned
Held held
God knows long wasted time
Lost tears swore Id get
amount freedom gets clean
Ive still got




lived learned
found turn around
see
never really meant
lied cried
watched part die
Cause amount freedom gets clean
Ive still got


Ive still got
Still got
