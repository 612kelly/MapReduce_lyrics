sensible incredible
single friends jealous
says everything need hear like
couldnt ask anything better
opens door get car
says look beautiful tonight

miss screaming fighting kissing rain
Im cursing name
Youre love act insane
thats way loved
Breaking coming undone
rollercoaster kind rush
never knew could feel much
thats way loved

Hes close mother
Talks business father
Hes charming endearing

miss screaming fighting kissing rain
Im cursing name
Youre love acted insane
thats way loved
Breaking coming undone
rollercoaster kind rush

hearts breaking
Cause Im feeling anything

Intoxicating complicated
Got away mistake


miss screaming fighting kissing rain
Im cursing name
Im love acted insane
thats way loved
Breaking coming undone
rollercoaster kind rush
never knew could feel much
thats way loved oh oh

thats way loved oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh whoa
Never knew could feel much
