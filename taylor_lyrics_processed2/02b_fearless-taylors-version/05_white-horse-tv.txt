Say youre sorry face angel
Comes need
paced back forth time
Cause honestly believed
Holdin days drag
Stupid girl shoulda known shoulda known


Im princess aint fairytale
Im one youll sweep feet lead stairwell
aint Hollywood small town
dreamer went let
late white horse
come around


Maybe nave got lost eyes
never really chance
mistake didnt know love
fight upper hand
many dreams
Happy endings know


Im princess aint fairytale
Im one youll sweep feet lead stairwell
aint Hollywood small town
dreamer went let
late white horse
come around


knees
Beggin forgiveness beggin
like always wanted
Im sorry


Cause Im princess aint fairytale
Im gonna find someone someday
might actually treat well
big world small town
rearview mirror disappearing
late white horse
late white horse
catch


Oh whoa whoa whoa
Try catch oh
late catch
