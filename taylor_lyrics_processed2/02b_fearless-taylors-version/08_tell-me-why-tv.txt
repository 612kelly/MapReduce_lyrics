took chance took shot
might think Im bulletproof Im
took swing took hard
ground see


Im sick tired attitude
Im feeling like dont know
tell love cut
need like heartbeat
know got mean streak
Makes run cover youre around
Heres temper
Yes remember said last night
know see youre doin
Tell


Well could write book
ruin someones perfect day
Well get confused frustrated
Forget Im tryin say oh


Im sick tired reasons
got one believe
tell want push around
need like heartbeat
know got mean streak
Makes run cover youre around
Heres temper
Yes remember said last night
know see youre doin
Tell


make feel small
feel whole inside
put dreams
youre thing mind


Im sick tired attitude
Feeling like dont know
tell want cut
Im sick tired reasons
Ive got one believe
ask love push around
Heres temper
Yes remember said last night
know see youre doin
Tell
Tell


take step back let go
told Im bulletproof
