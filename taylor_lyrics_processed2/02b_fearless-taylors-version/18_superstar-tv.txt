wrong cant help feel like
aint nothing right babe
Misty morning comes cant
Help wish could see face
knew first note played
Id breaking rules see
smile beautiful smile girls front row
Scream name


dim spotlight tell things like
cant keep eyes
Im one special another wideeyed girl
Whos desperately love
Give photograph hang wall superstar


Morning loneliness
Comes around Im dreaming
world wakes today
Youll another town
knew saw face
Id counting ways see
smile beautiful smile girls front row
Scream name


dim spotlight tell things like
cant take eyes
Im one special another wideeyed girl
Whos desperately love
Give photograph hang wall superstar


played bars play guitar
Im invisible everyone knows
youll never see sing sleep
Every night radio


dim spotlight tell things like
cant take eyes
Im one special another wideeyed girl
Whos desperately love
Give photograph hang wall superstar


Sweet sweet superstar
Superstar
