used walk along streets
porch lights shining bright
somewhere
Back night happy
recall good back snuck circus
threw arms around neck back deserved
happy


good baby good baby
showed em
one could touch way laughed dark
Talking bout daddys farm gonna buy someday
happy


used watch sun go boats water
Thats sorta feel right
goodbyes much harder cause happy


good baby good baby
showed em
one could touch way laughed dark
Talking bout daddys farm gonna buy someday
happy
happy


Oh hate voices telling Im love anymore
dont give choices thats tears
Cause happy
happy


good baby good baby
showed em
one could touch way laughed dark
Talking bout daddys farm
gonna marry
happy
happy
Ohohohoh
