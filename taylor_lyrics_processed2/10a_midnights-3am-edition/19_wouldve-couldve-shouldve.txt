wouldve blinked wouldve looked away first glance
tasted poison couldve spit first chance
paint splatter promising grown man
child matter got wash hands


Ooh ooh ooh
used pray
Wouldve couldve shouldve
never looked way
wouldve stayed knees


damn sure wouldve never danced devil
Gods honest truth pain heaven
Im grown Im scared ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
know wish left wondering


never touched wouldve gone along righteous
never blushed couldve never whispered
never saved boredom couldve gone
lord made feel important tried erase us


Ooh ooh ooh
Youre crisis faith
Wouldve couldve shouldve
Id played safe
wouldve stayed knees


damn sure wouldve never danced devil
Gods honest truth pain heaven
Im grown Im scared ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
know wish left wondering


God rest soul
miss used
tomb wont close
Stained glass windows mind
regret time
cant let go fight sleep
wound wont close
keep waiting sign
regret time


claritys death wont die
Years tearing banners
Living thrill hitting hurts
Give back girlhood mine first


damn sure wouldve never danced devil
Gods honest truth pain heaven
Im grown Im scared ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
know wish left wondering


God rest soul
miss used
tomb wont close
Stained glass windows mind
regret time
cant let go fight sleep
wound wont close
keep waiting sign
regret time
Oh God rest soul
miss used
tomb wont close
Stained glass windows mind
regret time
cant let go fight sleep
wound wont close
keep waiting sign
regret time
