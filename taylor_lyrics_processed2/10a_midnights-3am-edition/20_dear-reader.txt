Dear reader feels like trap
Youre already one
Dear reader get map
Pick somewhere run
Dear reader burn files
Desert past lives
dont recognize
means right


Never take advice someone whos falling apart
Never take advice someone whos falling apart


Dear reader bend
Snap
Dear reader dont answer
cause asked

Dear reader greatest luxuries secrets
Dear reader aim devil
Make sure dont miss


Never take advice someone whos falling apart
Never take advice someone whos falling apart


wander nights
prefer hiding plain sight
fourth drink hand
desperate prayers cursed man
Spilling free
darling darling please
wouldnt take word knew talking
knew walking
house home alone cause nobodys
pace pen friends found friends care
one sees lose youre playing solitaire


find another guiding light guiding light
shine bright
find another guiding light guiding light
shine bright
find another find another
Find another find another
find another
