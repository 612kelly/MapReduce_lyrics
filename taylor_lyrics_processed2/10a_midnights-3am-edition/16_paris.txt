ex friends sister
Met someone club kissed
Turns guy hooked ages ago
wannabe Z lister
outfits terrible
unbearable
see photos
didnt thanks though


Im love might stop breathing
Drew map bedroom ceiling
didnt see news
Cause somewhere else
Stumbled pretend alleyways cheap wine
Make believe champagne
taken view


Like Paris
Like somewhere else
Like Paris oh
somewhere else


Privacy sign door
page whole world
Romance dead keep
Levitated thought messes made
Sip wine side shade
kind thats thrown
mean kind tree grown


Im love might stop breathing
Drew map bedroom ceiling
didnt see news
Cause somewhere else
Stumbled pretend alleyways cheap wine
Make believe champagne
taken view


Like Paris oh
Like somewhere else
Like Paris oh
somewhere else


wanna brainwash
loving forever
wanna transport
somewhere cultures clever
Confess truth
swooping sloping cursive letters
Let flashing lights
tower midnight


mind
drew map bedroom ceiling
didnt see news
Cause somewhere else
alleyway drinking champagne


Cause Paris
Yes somewhere else
love Paris
Yes somewhere else
