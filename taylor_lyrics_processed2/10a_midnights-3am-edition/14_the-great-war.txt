knuckles bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls cursed sleep talked
Spineless tomb silence
Tore banners took battle underground
maybe ego swinging
Maybe
Flashes battle come back blur


blood shed crimson clover
Uhhuh sweet dream
hand one reached
throughout Great War
Always remember
Uhhuh tears ltter
vowed cry anymore
w survived Great War


drew good faith treaties
drew curtains closed drank poison alone
said trust freely
diesel desire playing fire
maybe past thats talking
Screaming crypt
Telling punish things never
justified


blood shed crimson clover
Uhhuh bombs close
hand one reached
throughout Great War
Always remember
Uhhuh burning embers
vowed fight anymore
survived Great War


Uhhuh uhhuh


turned something bigger
Somewhere haze got sense Id betrayed
finger hair pin triggers
Hold icy ground looked honor truth
Broken blue called troops
night nearly lost
really thought lost


plant memory garden
Say solemn prayer place poppy hair
Theres morning glory war wasnt fair
never go back


bloodshed crimson clover
Uhhuh worst
hand one reached
throughout Great War
Always remember
Uhhuh burn better
vowed would always
Cause survived Great War


Uhhuh uhhuh
would always
Cause survived Great War
Uhhuh
vowed would always
