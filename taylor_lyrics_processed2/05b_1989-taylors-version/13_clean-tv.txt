drought worst ahah ahah
flowers wed grown together died thirst
months months back forth ahah ahah
Youre still like winestained dress cant wear anymore


Hung head lost war
sky turned black like perfect storm


rain came pouring
drownin thats could finally breathe
mornin gone trace
think finally clean


nothin left ahah ahah
butterflies turnd dust covered whole room
punchd hole roof ahah ahah
Let flood carry away pictures


water filled lungs
screamed loud one heard thing


rain came pourin
drownin thats could finally breathe
mornin gone trace
think finally clean


think finally clean
Ahahahahah
Said think finally clean

Ten months sober must admit
youre clean dont mean dont miss
Ten months older wont give
Im clean Im never gonna risk
drought worst ahah ahah
flowers wed grown together died thirst


rain came pourin
drownin thats could finally breathe
mornin gone trace
think finally clean
rain came pourin
drownin thats could finally breathe
mornin gone trace
think finally clean

Think Im finally clean
Ahah ahah
Think Im finally clean
