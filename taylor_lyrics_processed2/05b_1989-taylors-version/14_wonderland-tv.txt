Flashin lights
took wrong turn
fell rabbit hole
held tight
Cause nothings seems
spinning control


Didnt tell us Dont rush things
Didnt flash green eyes
Havent heard becomes curious minds
Ooh didnt seem new excitin
felt arms twistin around
slept one eye open night


found Wonderland got lost
pretended could last forever eh
found Wonderland got lost
life never worse nevr better eh h


Wonderland
Wonderland
Wonderland
Wonderland


went way
love think straight
alone seemed
strangers watchin
whispers turned talkin
talking turned screams oh


Didnt tell us Dont rush things
Didnt flash green eyes
Didnt calm fears Cheshire cat smile
Ooh didnt seem new excitin
felt arms twistin around
fun games til somebody loses mind
darlin


found Wonderland got lost
pretended could last forever eh
found Wonderland got lost
life never worse never better eh eh


Wonderland eh eh
Wonderland
Wonderland woah
Wonderland


reached gone
knew go back home
searched world somethin else
make feel like
end Wonderland went mad
Oh


found Wonderland got lost
pretended could last forever
found Wonderland got lost
life never worse never better
found Wonderland got lost
pretended could last forever
found Wonderland got lost
life never worse never better
Wonderland
