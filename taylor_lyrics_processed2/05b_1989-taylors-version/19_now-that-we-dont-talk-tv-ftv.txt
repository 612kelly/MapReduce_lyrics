went party
heard everybody
part crowd like Red Sea
Dont even get started
get anxious though
way home
guess Ill never ever know
dont talk


grew hair long
got new icons
outside
looks like youre tryin lives
miss old ways
didnt change
guess dont say
dont talk


call mom said best
Remind mor gave youd want less
cannot b friend pay price lost
cost dont talk


tell friends
Shared dinners long weekends
Truth cant pretend
Platonic ended


call mom said get chest
Remind way faded til left
cannot friend pay price lost
cost dont talk


dont pretend like acid rock
Id like mega yacht
important men think important thoughts
Guess maybe better dont talk
way back dignity
turn shrouded mystery
like chasing
Guess dont talk
