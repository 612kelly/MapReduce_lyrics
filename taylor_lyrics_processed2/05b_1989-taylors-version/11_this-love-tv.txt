Clear blue water
High tide came brought
could go
Skies grew darker
Currents swept
gone gone gone gone


silent screams wildest dreams
never dreamed


love good love bad
love alive back dead oh
hands let go free
love came back oh
Oh oh


Tossing turning
Struggled night someone new
Baby could go
Lantern burning
Flickered mind
still gone gone gone


losin grip sinking ships
showed time


love good love bad
love alive back dead oh
hands let go free
love came back oh
love left permanent mark
love glowing dark oh
hands let go free
love came back oh








kiss cheek watched leave
smile ghost fell knees
youre young run
come back need


love good love bad
love alive back dead oh
hands let go free
love came back oh
love left permanent mark
love glowing dark oh
hands let go free
love came back oh





love came back oh
