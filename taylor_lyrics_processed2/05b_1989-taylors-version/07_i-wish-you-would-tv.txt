Youre thinkin hate
Cause still dont know never said

Wish never hung phone like
Wish knew
Ill never forget long live
Wish right right good

Headlights pass window pane think
crooked love straight line
Makes want run hide
makes turn right back around


wish would come back
Wish never hung phone like
Wish knew
Ill never forget long live
Wish right right good

wish could go back
remember fightin
Wish knew
miss much mad anymore
Wish right right good
