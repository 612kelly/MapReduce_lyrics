people called unmarked numbers
peripheral vision
let slide like hose slippery plastic summer
quickly forgiven
magnetic almost obnoxious
Flush currency cool
always turnin empty pockets
came


didnt come make friends
born suburban legends
hold holds together
kiss way thats gonna screw forever


fantasy maybe mismatched star signs
Would surprise whole school
ended back class reunion
Walkin
Youd chapter old diaries
pages ripped
standin gymnasium
still see


didnt come make friends
born suburban legends
hold holds together
kiss way thats gonna screw forever
know still remember
born national treasures
told wed get back together
kissed way thats gonna screw forever


Ticktock clock pace block
broke heart cause polite
Waves crash shore dash door
dont knock anymore whole lifes ruined
Ticktock clock pace block
broke heart cause polite
Waves crash shore dash door
dont knock anymore always knew
life would ruined
