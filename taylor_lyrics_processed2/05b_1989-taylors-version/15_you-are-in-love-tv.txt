One look dark room meant
Time moved fast play back
Buttons coat lighthearted joke
proof much saw enough
Small talk drives coffee midnight
light reflects chain neck
says Look shoulders brush
proof one touch felt enough


hear silence silence
feel way home way home
see lights lights
love true love love


Morning plac burnt toast Sunday
keep shirt keeps word
let go fars ghosts
One step much said enough
kiss sidewalks fight talk
One night wakes strange look face
Pauses says Youre best friend
knew love


hear silence silence
feel way home way home
see lights lights
love true love love


goes
two dancing snow globe round round
keeps picture office downtown
understand
lost minds fought wars
Ive spent whole life trying put words


Cause hear silence
feel way home
see lights
love true love love


hear silence silence
feel way home way home
see lights lights
love true love love
hear silence silence
feel way home way home
see lights lights
love true love love
