Im five years old getting cold Ive got big coat
hear laugh look smiling run run
Past pumpkin patch tractor rides
Look sky gold
hug legs fall asleep way home


dont know trees change fall
know youre scared anything
Dont know Snow Whites house near far away
know best day today


Im thirteen
dont know friends could mean
come home crying hold tight grab keys
drive drive found town far enough away
talk window shop til Ive forgotten names


dont know Im going talk school
know Im laughing car ride home
Dont know long going take feel okay
know best day today


excellent father strength making stronger
God smiles little brother inside
Hes better
grew pretty house space run
best days


video found back three
set paint set kitchen youre talking
age princesses pirate ships seven dwarfs
Daddys smart
youre prettiest lady whole wide world


know trees change fall
know side even wrong
love giving eyes
staying back watching shine
didnt know knew Im taking chance say
best day today
