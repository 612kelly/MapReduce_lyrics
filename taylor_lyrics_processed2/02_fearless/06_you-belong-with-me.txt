Youre phone girlfriend shes upset
Shes going something said
Cause doesnt get humor like

Im listening kind music doesnt like

Hey isnt easy

Shes Cheer Captain Im bleachers
Dreaming day wake find

Standing waiting back door
time could know baby

Oh remember driving house

tell bout dreams
Think know belong
Think know


Cant see Im one understands
along cant see

Standing waiting back door
time could know baby
