Hopin one senior boys wink say

Well count ten take

Laughin girls think theyre cool
Well outta soon

Cause youre fifteen somebody tells love
Youre gonna believe

Makes head spin round

Dating boy football team

Wish could go back tell know
Back swore gonna marry someday
realized bigger dreams mine

Cause youre fifteen somebody tells love
Youre gonna believe
