see face mind drive away
Cause none us thought gonna end way
People people sometimes change minds
killing see go time


Music starts playing like end sad movie
kind ending dont really wanna see
Cause tragedy itll bring
dont know without around


know never simple never easy
Never clean break one save
Youre thing know like back hand


cant breathe without
Breathe without


Never wanted never wanna see hurt
Every little bump road tried swerve
people people sometimes doesnt work
Nothing say gonna save us fall

know never simple never easy
Never clean break one save
Youre thing know like back hand


cant breathe without
Breathe without


feeling like lost friend
Hope know easy easy
feeling like lost friend
Hope know aint easy easy


know never simple never easy
Never clean break one save ohoh


cant breathe without
Breathe without
Breathe without


Im sorry Im sorry
Im sorry Im sorry
Im sorry Im sorry
Im sorry
