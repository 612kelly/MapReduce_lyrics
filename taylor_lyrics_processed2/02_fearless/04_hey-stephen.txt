Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm
Mmmmm mmmm yeah


Hey Stephen know looks deceiving
know saw light
walked talking
didnt say half things wanted
girls tossing rocks window
Ill one waiting even cold
Hey Stephen boy might believing
dont always alone


Cause cant help look like angel
Cant help wanna kiss rain
Come feel magic Ive feeling since met
Cant help theres one else
Mmm cant help


Hey Stephen Ive holding back feeling
got things say
Ive seen thought
never seen nobody shine way
way walk way talk way say name
beautiful wonderful dont ever change
Hey Stephen people always leaving
think stay


Cause cant help look like angel
Cant help wanna kiss rain
Come feel magic Ive feeling since met
Cant help theres one else
Mmm cant help


Theyre dimming street lights youre perfect
arent tonight
Im waiting alone come come
pull near shine shine shine
Hey Stephen could give fifty reasons
one choose
girls well theyre beautiful
would write song


cant help look like angel
Cant help wanna kiss rain
Come feel magic Ive feeling since met
Cant help theres one else
Mmm cant help
look like angel
Cant help wanna kiss rain
Come feel magic Ive feeling since met
Cant help theres one else
Mmm cant help



Cant help
cant help
