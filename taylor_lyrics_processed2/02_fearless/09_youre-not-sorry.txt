time wasting hoping would come around
Ive giving chances every time let
taken long baby Ive figured
youre thinking well fine time around


dont call anymore
wont pick phone
last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
tell youre sorry
dont believe baby like
Youre sorry


Youre looking innocent might believe didnt know
Couldve loved life hadnt left waiting cold

Im tired last know oh
youre asking listen cause worked time


dont call anymore
wont pick phone
last straw
Dont wanna hurt anymore
tell youre sorry
dont believe baby like
Youre sorry
Youre sorry

crawling honey never wouldve gone away
used shine bright watched fade


dont call anymore
wont pick phone
last straw
Theres nothing left beg
tell youre sorry
dont believe baby like
Youre sorry
Youre sorry

Woah oh oh oh oh oh oh
