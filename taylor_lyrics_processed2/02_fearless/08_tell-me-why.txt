took chance took shot
might think Im bulletproof Im
took swing took hard

Im sick tired attitude
Im feeling like dont know
tell love cut

Well get confused frustrated
Forget Im trying say oh


Im sick tired reasons
got one believe
tell want push around
need like heartbeat
know got mean streak
makes run cover youre around
Heres temper
Yes remember said last night
know see youre

Im sick tired attitude
Im feeling like dont know

Im sick tired reasons
Ive got one believe
ask love push around
Heres temper
Yes remember said last night
know see youre
