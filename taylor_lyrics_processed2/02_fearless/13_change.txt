sad picture final blow hits
Somebody else gets wanted
know another time place
Repeating history youre getting sick
believe whatever
Ill anything see


things change
feel
walls put hold us back fall
revolution time come
us finally win
well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Oh oh


weve outnumbered raided cornered
hard fight fight aint fair
getting stronger find things never found
might bigger faster never scared
walk away say dont need
theres something eyes says beat


Cause things change
feel
walls put hold us back fall
revolution time come
us finally win
well sing hallelujah well sing hallelujah
Oh oh


Tonight stand get knees
Fight weve worked years
battle long fight lives
well stand champions tonight


night things changed
see
walls put hold us back fell
revolution throw hands
Cause never gave
well sing hallelujah sang hallelujah
Hallelujah
