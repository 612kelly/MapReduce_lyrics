born arms imaginary friends
Free roam made home everywhere Ive
come crashing like realest thing
Trying best understand love bring


Oh half hearts got grip situation
Half heart takes time
Half hearts got right mind tell
cant keep loving
Oh half heart


made believe Id never love somebody else
Made plan stay man love
Lonely song sang day came
Showing another way love bring


Oh half hearts got grip situation
Half heart takes time
Half hearts got right mind tell
cant keep loving
Oh half heart


faith strong
fall short long
road later
hate never gave half heart
cant stop loving


cant stop loving

cant stop loving half
Half heart
Half heart


Half hearts got real cool imagination
Half hearts got
Half hearts got right mind tell
Half heart wont


Half heart shotgun wedding bride paper ring
half heart part man whos never truly loved anything
Half heart
Half heart
Half heart
Half heart
Half heart
Half heart
