wish strong enough lift one us
day strong enough lift one us


Uhh
Ever thought losing
moneys gone lose whip
might lose grip landlord tell due rent
grass green side
Make nigga wanna run straight fence
Open fridge bout times
still cant find food
Thats foolishness
sometimes wonder care much way look
way talk way act clothes bought
much cost
even really matter
Cause life uphill battle
yall tryna climb ol ladder
boat ol paddle
shallow Im askin
Whats pattern madness
Everybody aint number one draft pick
us aint Hollywood actors
one one
maybe one day could ball
one time underdogs
Sincerely one yall


wish strong enough lift one us
day strong enough lift one us


could feel pain could feel struggle
wanna live everythings low
could drown puddle
Thats gotta hold us yeah hold us
times ones ever spoke us
every single time play song
say thats Bobby Ray wrote us
tides get high
sea underneath gets deep
feel like youre another person
Getting lost crowd way high nosebleeds
Uh weve us
still stand tall shoulders
even though always odds
things thatve molded us
life hadnt chosen us
Sometimes wonder wouldve wound
Cause Id make new blueprint
build ground hey
one one
maybe one day could ball
one time underdogs
Bobby Ray yall


wish strong enough lift one us
day strong enough lift one us
