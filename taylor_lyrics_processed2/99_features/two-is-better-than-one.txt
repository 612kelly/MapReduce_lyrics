remember wore first day
came life thought
Hey know could something
Cause everything words say
know takes breath away
Im left nothing


maybe true cant live without
maybe two better one
theres much time figure rest life
youve already got coming undone
Im thinking two better one


remember every look upon face
way roll eyes way taste
make hard breathing
Cause close eyes drift away
think everythings okay
Im finally believing


maybe true cant live without
maybe two better one
theres much time figure rest life
youve already got coming undone
Im thinking two better one
Yeah yeah


remember wore first day
came life thought hey


Maybe true cant live without
maybe two better one
theres much time figure rest life
youve already got coming undone


Im thinking ooh cant live without
Cause baby two better one
Theres much time figure rest life
Ill figure thats said done
Two better one
Two better one
