get twisted threads
meet Alcott
Id go corner back
youd always
sittin usual
golden notebook
Writing something someone
used


last thing wanted
first thing
tell problems
tell truth
last thing wanted
first thing
tell think Im fallin
Back love


sit silently
Waitin look
see smile
see
something
break golden thinking
many times
youll still believe


last thing wanted

first thing

tell problems

tell truth

last thing wanted

tell think Im fallin
Back love


Ill ruin
Ill ruin
Ill ruin
like always
Ill ruin

Ill ruin

Ill ruin

like always



last thing wanted

first thing

tell problems

tell truth

last thing wanted

first thing

tell think Im fallin
Back love
Back love


Back love
