Bet windows rolled hairs pulled back
bet got idea youre going way fast
Youre trying think went wrong
Trying stop til get goin
Youre trying stay awake bet turn radio
song goes


cant live without cant live without baby
cant live without cant live without baby oh baby


highway wont hold tonight
highway dont know youre alive
highway dont care youre alone

highway wont dry tears
highway dont need
highway dont care youre coming home



bet got dead cell phone shotgun seat
Yeah bet youre bending Gods ear talking bout
Youre trying let first tear fall
Youre trying think turning around
Youre trying get lost sound song always
sing along


cant live without cant live without baby
cant live without cant live without baby oh baby


highway wont hold tonight
highway dont know youre alive
highway dont care youre alone

highway wont dry tears
highway dont need
highway dont care youre coming home



cant live without cant live without baby
cant live without cant live without baby oh baby
