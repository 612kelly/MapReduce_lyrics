Im walking fast traffic lights
Busy streets busy lives
know touch go
alone changing minds
fall love till hurts bleeds fades time


never saw coming
Ill never


come around armor falls
Pierce room like cannon ball
know dont let go
alone
room slates clean
twin fire signs four blue eyes


never saint
Ive loved shades wrong
learn live pain
Mosaic broken hearts
love brave wild

never saw coming
Ill never


state grace
worthwhile fight
Love ruthless game
Unless play good right
hands fate
Youre Achilles heel
golden age something good
right real


never saw coming
Ill never
never saw coming
Ill never


state grace
worthwhile fight
Love ruthless game
Unless play good right
