Loving like
Driving new Maserati dead end street
Faster wind passionate sin ending suddenly
Loving like
Trying change mind youre already flying freefall
Like colors autumn
bright lose


Losing blue like Id never known
Missing dark grey alone
Forgetting like trying know somebody youve never met
loving red
Loving red


Touching like
Realizing ever wanted right front
Memorizing
Easy knowing words old favorite song
Fighting like
Trying solve crossword realizing theres right answer
Regretting like
Wishing never found love could strong


Losing blue like Id never known
Missing dark grey alone
Forgetting like trying know somebody youve never met
loving red
Oh red
Burning red


Remembering comes flashbacks echoes
Tell time gotta let go
moving impossible
still see head
burning red
Burning red


Losing blue like Id never known
Missing dark grey alone
Forgetting like trying know somebody never met
Cause loving red
Yeah yeah red
burning red


thats hes spinning round head
Burning red burning red


love like
Driving new Maserati dead end street
