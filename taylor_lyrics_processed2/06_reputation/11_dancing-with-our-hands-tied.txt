loved secret
First sight yeah love without reason
Oh twentyfive years old
Oh know
love frozen
Deep blue painted golden
Oh held close
Oh know


Couldve spent forever hands pockets
Picture face invisible locket
said nothing world could stop
bad feeling
darling turned bed sacred oasis
People started talking putting us paces
knew one world could take
bad feeling


dancing
Dancing hands tied hands tied
Yeah dancing
Like first time first time
Yeah dancing
Dancing hands tied hands tied
Yeah dancing
bad feeling
dancing


loved spite
Deep fears world would divide us
baby dance
Oh avalanche
Say say got
Im mess Im mess wanted
Oh cause gravity
Oh keeping


Couldve spent forever hands pockets
Picture face invisible locket
said nothing world could stop
bad feeling


dancing
Dancing hands tied hands tied
Yeah dancing
Like first time first time
Yeah dancing
Dancing hands tied hands tied
Yeah dancing

bad feeling
dancing


Id kiss lights went
Swaying room burned
Id hold water rushes
could dance
Id kiss lights went
Swaying room burned
Id hold water rushes
could dance


Dancing hands tied hands tied
Oh yeah dancing
Like first time first time
Yeah dancing
Dancing hands tied hands tied

Yeah dancing
bad feeling
dancing



Hands tied hands tied
