Knew killer first time saw
Wondered many girls loved left haunted
hes ghost phantom
Holdin ransom
boys tryin hard dont try though
Younger exes act like man
see nothing better keep forever
Like vendettata

Touch youll never alone
IIsland breeze lights low
one know


middle night dreams
see things baby
middle night dreams
know Im gonna take time
ready


Knew robber first time saw
Stealing hearts running never sayin sorry

Well move island
jailer Burton Taylor
Every love Ive known comparison failure
forget names Im tame
Never

Touch youll never alone
IIsland breeze lights low
one know


middle night dreams
see things baby
middle night dreams
know Im gonna take time
ready
