nothing good starts getaway car


best times worst crimes
struck match blew mind
didnt mean
didnt see
ties black lies white
shades gray candlelight
wanted leave
needed reason


X marks spot fell apart
poisoned well lyin
knew first Old Fashioned cursed
never shotgun shot dark


drivin getaway car
flyin wed never get far
Dont pretend mystery
Think place first met
Ridin getaway car
sirens beat heart
Shouldve known Id first leave
Think place first met
getaway car ohohoh
never get far ohohahh
nothing good starts getaway car


great escape prison break
light freedom face
werent thinkin
drinkin
runnin us screamin Go go go
three us honey sideshow
circus aint love story
sorry


X marks spot fell apart
poisoned well every man
knew first Old Fashioned cursed
hit like shotgun shot heart


drivin getaway car
flyin wed never get far
Dont pretend mystery
Think place first met
Ridin getaway car
sirens beat heart
Shouldve known Id first leave
Think place first met
getaway car ohohoh
never get far ohohahh
nothing good starts getaway car

Drivin getaway car
flyin wed never get far
Dont pretend mystery
Think place first met
Ridin getaway car
sirens beat heart
Shouldve known Id first leave
Think place first met

nothing good starts getaway car
