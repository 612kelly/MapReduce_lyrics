Theres glitter floor party
Girls carrying shoes lobby
Candle wax Polaroids hardwood floor
night


Dont read last page
stay youre lost Im scared youre turning away
want midnights
Ill cleaning bottles New Years Day


squeeze hand three times back taxi
tell gonna long road
Ill youre toast town babe
strike youre crawling home


Dont read last page
stay hard wrong making mistakes
want midnights
Ill cleaning bottles New Years Day


Hold memories hold
Hold memories hold
Hold memories hold
hold


Please dont ever become stranger
Whose laugh could recognize anywhere
Please dont ever become stranger
Whose laugh could recognize anywhere


Theres glitter floor party
Girls carrying shoes lobby
Candle wax Polaroids hardwood floor
forevermore


Dont read last page
stay hard wrong making mistakes
want midnights
Ill cleaning bottles New Years Day


Hold memories hold
Hold memories hold
Hold memories hold
hold


Please dont ever become stranger

Whose laugh could recognize anywhere

Please dont ever become stranger

Whose laugh could recognize anywhere
