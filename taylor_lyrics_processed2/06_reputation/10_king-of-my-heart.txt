Im perfectly fine live
made mind Im better bein alone
met weeks ago
try callin Baby like tryin clothes


Salute Im American queen
move like Im Motown beat
rule kingdom inside room
Cause boys expensive cars
Range Rovers Jaguars
Never took quite


one waiting
King heart body soul ooh whoa
youre want Ill never let go
King heart body soul ooh whoa


Ive waiting waiting
Ooh whoa ooh whoa
one waiting waiting
Body soul ooh whoa



Late night citys asleep
love secret Im hoping dreaming dying keep
Change priorities
taste lips idea luxury


Salute Im American queen
move like Im Motown beat
rule kingdom inside room

Cause boys expensive cars
Range Rovers Jaguars
Never took quite


one waiting
King heart body soul ooh whoa
youre want Ill never let go
King heart body soul ooh whoa


Ive waiting waiting
Ooh whoa ooh whoa
one
waiting waiting
Body soul ooh whoa



end endings
broken bones mending
nights spending
roof school girl crush
Drinking beer plastic cups
Say fancy fancy stuff
Baby enough


one waiting
King heart body soul ooh whoa
one waiting
King heart body soul ooh whoa
youre want Ill never let go
King heart body soul ooh whoa


Ive waiting waiting
Ooh whoa ooh whoa

Cause youre one waiting waiting
Body soul ooh whoa
