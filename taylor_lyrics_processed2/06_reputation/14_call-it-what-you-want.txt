castle crumbled overnight
brought knife gunfight

Nobodys heard months

Cause


babys fit like daydream
Walking head

Call want
babys fly like jet stream
High whole scene
Loves like Im brand new
call want yeah

flowers grew back thorns
Windows boarded storm
built fire keep warm
drama queens taking swings
jokers dressing kings
fade nothing look
know make mistakes every time
Bridges burn never learn
least one thing right

Im laughing lover makin forts covers
Trust like brother
Yeah know one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin darkest night


babys fit like daydream
Walking head
Im one hes walking
call want yeah
Call want
babys fly like jet stream
High whole scene
Loves like Im brand new

call want yeah
Call want

Holding breath slowly said

High whole scene
Loves like Im brand new
