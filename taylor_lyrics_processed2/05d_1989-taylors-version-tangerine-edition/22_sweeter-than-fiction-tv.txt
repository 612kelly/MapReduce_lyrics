Hit ground hit ground hit ground oh oh
sound sound hear
never saw comin slipped started runnin
youve come undone


Seen fall seen crawl knees eh ayy
Seen lost crowd seen colors fade
Wish could make better someday wont remember
pain thought would last forever ever


youll stand ten feet tall

eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction


shot shot dark oh oh
got got shattered hopes
never saw comin hit ground runnin
youre somethin say


sight sight light came
Proved right proved right proved wrong
perfect weather like dont remember
rain thought would last forever ever


youll stand ten feet tall
say knew along
eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction
youll stand next
rest history
eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction


Ill one many sayin
Look look
Ill one many saying
Youve made us proud youve made us proud proud
Ill one many sayin
Look look
Ill one many sayin
Youve made us proud youve made us proud proud

hit ground hit ground hit ground oh oh
sound sound heard
perfect weather like dont remember
rain thought would last forever ever


youll stand ten feet tall
say knew along
eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction
youll stand next
rest history
eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction
