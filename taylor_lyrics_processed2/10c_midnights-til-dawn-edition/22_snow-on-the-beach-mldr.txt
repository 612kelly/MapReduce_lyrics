One night moons ago
saw flecks couldve lights
might
Passing unbeknownst
Life emotionally abusive
time cant stop quite like
flight awful thanks asking
Im unglued thanks


like snow beach
Weird fuckin beautiful
Flying dream
Stars pocketful
wanting
Tonight feels impossible
comin
sound around


Like snow beach
Like snow beach
Like snow beach
Like snow ah ah


scene feels like saw screen
searched aurora borealis green
Ive never seen someone lit within
Blurring periphery
smile like contest
hide would dishonest
fine fake til make
Til til true


like snow beach
Weird fuckin beautiful
Flying dream
Stars pocketful
wanting
Tonight feels impossible
comin
sound around


Like snow beach
Like snow beach
Like snow beach
Like snow ah ah


cant speak afraid jinx
dont even dare wish
eyes flying saucers another planet
Im like Janet
real thing


falling like snow beach
Weird fuckin beautiful
Flying dream
Stars pocketful
wanting
Tonight feels impossible
comin
sound around


Like snow beach

Like snow beach

Like snow beach

Like snow ah
comin
sound around

Like snow beach
Like snow like snow uhhuh yeah
