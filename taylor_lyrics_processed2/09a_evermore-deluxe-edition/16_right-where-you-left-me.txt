Friends break friends get married
Strangers get born strangers get buried
Trends change rumors fly new skies
Im right left
Matches burn
Pages turn stick
Wages earned lessons learned
Im right left


Help Im still restaurant
Still sitting corner haunt
Crosslegged dim light
say sad sight
swear could hear hair pin drop
Right felt moment stop
Glass shattered white cloth
Everybody moved stayed
Dust collected pinnedup hair
expected find somewhere
perspective sat stared


Right left
left left
left choice stay forever
left left oh left
left choice stay forever


ever hear girl got frozen
Time went everybody else wont know
Shes still twentythree inside fantasy
supposed
hear girl lives delusion
Breakups happen every day dont lose
Shes still twentythree inside fantasy
youre sitting front


restaurant still one want
Crosslegged dim light everything right
could feel mascara run
told met someone
Glass shattered white cloth
Everybody moved


Help Im still restaurant
Still sitting corner haunt
Crosslegged dim light
say sad sight
stayed
Dust collected pinnedup hair
Im sure got wife
Kids Christmas Im unaware
Cause Im right cause harm
Mind business
love died young
cant bear witness
long
ever think got wrong


Im right
left
left oh left
left choice stay forever
left
left oh left
left choice stay forever
