dinner cold chatter gets old
ask tab
moment hes insisting friends
Look like
words sister come back whispers
prove fact seemed
twin dreams
Shes crook caught


old familiar body ache
snaps little breaks soul
know time go


Twenty years job
son boss gets spot
trying stay kids
keeping break hearts worse


old familiar body ache
snaps little breaks soul
know time go


Sometimes giving strong thing
Sometimes run brave thing
Sometimes walking one thing
find right thing
Sometimes giving strong thing
Sometimes run brave thing
Sometimes walking one thing
find right thing


Fifteen years fifteen million tears
Begging til knees bled
gave gave nothing
wondered left
sits throne palace bones
Praying greed
Hes got past frozen behind glass
Ive got


old familiar body ache
snaps little breaks soul
know time go


Sometimes giving strong thing
Sometimes run brave thing
Sometimes walking one thing
find right thing
Sometimes giving strong thing
Sometimes run brave thing
Sometimes walking one thing
find right thing


find right thing
know soul
know soul
time go
know know know know
time go
go
go
go
