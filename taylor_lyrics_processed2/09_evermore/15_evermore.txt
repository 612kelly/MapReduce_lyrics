Gray November
Ive since July
Motion capture
Put bad light
replay footsteps stepping stone
Trying find one went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed fire


catching breath
Staring open window
Catching death
couldnt sure
feeling peculiar
pain would
Evermore


Hey December
Guess Im feeling unmoored
Cant remember
used fight
rewind tape pause
moment lost
Sending signals
doublecrossed


catching breath
Barefoot wildest winter
Catching death
couldnt sure
feeling peculiar
pain would
Evermore



Cant think cost
things lost
Oh get pause
certain well tall
Whether weather frost
violence dog days
Im waves tossed
line could go cross


shipwrecked
thought
cracks light
dreamed
real enough
get



swear



catching breath
Floors cabin creaking step
couldnt sure
feeling peculiar
pain wouldnt
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
pain wouldnt evermore
Evermore
