Gleaming twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships waters
inviting almost jump


dont like gold rush gold rush
dont like anticipatin face red flush
dont like anyone would die feel touch
Everybody wants
Everybody wonders would like love
Walk past quick brush
dont like slow motion double vision rose blush
dont like falling feels like flying til bone crush
Everybody wants
dont like gold rush


must like grow beautiful
hair falling place like dominoes
see padding across wooden floors
Eagles tshirt hanging door


dinner parties call contrarian shit
coastal town wandered round never seen love pure
fades gray dayold tea
Cause could never


Cause dont like gold rush gold rush
dont like anticipatin face red flush
dont like anyone would die feel touch
Everybody wants
Everybody wonders would like love
Walk past quick brush
dont like slow motion double vision rose blush
dont like falling feels like flying til bone crush
Everybody wants
dont like gold rush


must like grow beautiful
hair falling place like dominoes
mind turns life folklore
cant dare dream anymore


dinner parties wont call contrarian shit
coastal town never found never see love pure
Cause fades gray dayold tea
Cause never


Gleaming twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships waters
inviting almost jump
