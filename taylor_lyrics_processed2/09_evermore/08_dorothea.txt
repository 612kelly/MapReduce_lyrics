Hey Dorothea ever stop think

Honey making lark misery
got shiny friends since left town
tiny screens place see
got nothing well wishes ya


Ooh place ever
Ooh wont like way


never late come back side
stars eyes shined brighter Tupelo

Hey Dorothea ever stop think
calmer skipping prom piss mom pageant schemes

still soul met bleachers Well

never late come back side
stars eyes shined brighter Tupelo
youre ever tired known know
know youll always know Dorothea
Dorothea
