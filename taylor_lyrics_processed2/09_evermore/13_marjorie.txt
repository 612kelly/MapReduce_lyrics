Youre alive alive


Never polite

Id think listening

Id think still around

Youre alive youre alive head
died didnt stay dead

Youre alive alive


autumn chill wakes
loved amber skies much
Long limbs frozen swims
Youd always go past feet could touch
complained whole way
car ride back stairs
shouldve asked questions
shouldve asked
Asked write
Shouldve kept every grocery store receipt
Cause every scrap would taken
Watched signed name Marjorie
closets backlogged dreams
left


died didnt stay dead
died didnt stay dead
Youre alive youre alive head
died didnt stay dead
died didnt stay dead
Youre alive alive


didnt know better
Id think singing
didnt know better
Id think still around
know better
still feel around
know better
youre still around
