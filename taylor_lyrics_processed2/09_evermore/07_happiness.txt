Honey Im trees
see
Im right years Ive given
shit dividin
Showed hiding spots
dancing music stopped
disbelief cant face reinvention
havent met new yet


Therell happiness
happiness
things true
happiness


Past blood bruise
Past curses cries
Beyond terror nightfall
Haunted look eyes
wouldve loved lifetime
Leave behind
happiness


Tell winning smile
Begin look like smirk
lessons start look like weapons
Pointed deepest hurt
hope shell beautiful fool
takes spot next
didnt mean
Sorry cant see facts fury
havent met new yet


Therell happiness
happiness
things believe
happiness


history across great divide
glorious sunrise
Dappled flickers light
dress wore midnight leave behind
happiness


cant make go away making villain
guess price paid seven years Heaven
pulled body mine
Every goddamn night get fake niceties
one teaches
good man hurts
know hurt


Honey Im trees
see
eyes leak acid rain pillow used lay head
giving best
Tell give
want green light forgiveness
havent met new yet
think shell give


Therell happiness
happiness
things true
happiness


history across great divide
glorious sunrise
Dappled flickers light
dress wore midnight leave behind
Oh leave behind
Leave behind
happiness
