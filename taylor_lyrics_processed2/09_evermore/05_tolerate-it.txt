sit watch reading head low
wake watch breathing eyes closed
sit watch
notice everything dont
Youre much older wiser


wait door like Im kid
Use best colors portrait
Lay table fancy shit
watch tolerate
head tell
Tell Ive got wrong somehow
know love celebrated
tolerate


greet battle heros welcome
take indiscretions good fun
sit listen polish plates gleam glisten
Youre much older wiser


wait door like Im kid
Use best colors portrait
Lay table fancy shit
watch tolerate
head tell
Tell Ive got wrong somehow
know love celebrated
tolerate


building worlds
Wheres man whod throw blankets barbed wire
made temple mural sky
Im begging footnotes story life
Drawing hearts byline
Always taking much space time
assume Im fine would


Break free leave us ruins
Took dagger removed
Gain weight lose
Believe could
head tell
Tell Ive got wrong somehow
know love celebrated
tolerate


sit watch
