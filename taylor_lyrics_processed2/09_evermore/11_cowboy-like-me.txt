tennis court covered
tentlike thing
asked dance
said Dancin dangerous game


Oh thought
gonna one things
know
Im never gonna love


Ive got tricks sleeve
Takes one know one
Youre cowboy like


Never wanted love
fancy car
Im waiting phone
Like Im sitting airport bar


tricks sleeve
Takes one know one
Youre cowboy like


Perched dark
Telling rich folks anything wanna hear
Like could love
could way forward
pay
Youre bandit like


Eyes full stars
Hustling good life
Never thought Id meet
could love
could way forward
know Ill pay


Youre cowboy like


Perched dark
Telling rich folks anything wanna hear
Like could love
could way forward
pay
Youre bandit like


Eyes full stars
Hustling good life
Never thought Id meet
could love
could way forward
know Ill pay


skeletons closets
Plotted hard fuck
old men Ive swindled
Really believe one
ladies lunching stories
passed town
locked


hang lips
Like Gardens Babylon
boots beneath bed
Forever sweetest con


Ive tricks sleeve
Takes one know one
Youre cowboy like


Im never gonna love
Im never gonna love
Im never gonna love
