wanted know hanging
gone wouldve asked
kind cold fogs windshield glass
felt passed
Theres ache put ache




could call even
could call babe weekend
Tis damn season write
Im stayin parents house
road taken looks real good
always leads hometown


parked car right Methodist
school used
holidays linger like bad perfume
run far
escaped remember watched leave
okay okay


could call even
could call babe weekend
Tis damn season write
Im stayin parents house
road taken looks real good
Time flies messy mud truck tires
Im missing smile hear
could ride around
road taken looks real good
always leads hometown


Sleep half day old times sake
wont ask wait dont ask stay
Ill go back LA socalled friends
Wholl write books ever make
wonder soul
tell smiles Im fakin
heart know Im breakin
leave warmest bed Ive ever known
could call even
Even though Im leaving
Ill weekend
Tis damn season


could call even
could call babe weekend
Tis damn season write
Im stayin parents house
road taken looks real good
Time flies messy mud truck tires
Im missing smile hear
could ride around
road taken looks real good
always leads hometown


always leads hometown
