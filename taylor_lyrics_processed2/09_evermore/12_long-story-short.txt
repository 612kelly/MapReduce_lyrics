Fatefully
tried pick battles til battle picked
Misery
Like war words shouted sleep
passed right
alley surrounded sides
knife cuts ways
shoe fits walk til high heels break


fell pedestal
Right rabbit hole
Long story short bad time
Pushed precipice
Clung nearest lips
Long story short wrong guy


Im
Im ah
Yeah yeah
Im ah
Yeah yeah


Actually
always felt must look better rear view
Missing
golden gates held keys
dropped sword
threw bushes knocked door
live peace
someone comes us time Im ready


Cause fell pedestal
Right rabbit hole
Long story short bad time
Pushed precipice
Clung nearest lips
Long story short wrong guy


Im
Im ah
Yeah yeah
Im


keepin score
keep warm
tug war
know theres
keepin score
keep warm
waves meet shore
Ever evermore


Past
wanna tell get lost petty things
nemeses
defeat get chance swing
hes passing
Rare glimmer comet sky
feels like home
shoe fits walk everywhere go


fell pedestal
Right rabbit hole
Long story short bad time
Pushed precipice
Climbed right back cliff
Long story short survived


Im
Im ah
Im
Im ah
Yeah yeah
Im
Yeah yeah
Im


Long story short bad time
Long story short survived
