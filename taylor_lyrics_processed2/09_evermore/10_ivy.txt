Hows one know
Id meet spirit meets bones
faithforgotten land
snow
touch brought forth incandescent glow
Tarnished grand


old widow goes stone every day
dont sit wait
Grieving living


Oh goddamn
pain fits palm freezing hand
Taking mine promised another
Oh cant
Stop putting roots dreamland
house stone ivy grows
Im covered


wish know
fatal flaw makes long
Magnificently cursed
Hes room
opal eyes wish see
wants whats


Oh goddamn
pain fits palm freezing hand
Taking mine promised another
Oh cant
Stop putting roots dreamland
house stone ivy grows
Im covered


Clover blooms fields
Spring breaks loose time near
would found us
Crescent moon coast clear
Spring breaks loose fear
Hes gonna burn house ground
Hows one know
Id live die moments stole
begged borrowed time
tell run
dare sit watch well become
drink husbands wine


Oh goddamn
pain fits palm freezing hand
Taking mine promised another
Oh cant
Stop putting roots dreamland
house stone ivy grows
Im covered
Im covered


yeah fire
goddamn blaze dark
started
started
yeah war
goddamn fight life
started
started


Oh cant
Stop putting roots dreamland
house stone ivy grows
Im covered

Im covered
