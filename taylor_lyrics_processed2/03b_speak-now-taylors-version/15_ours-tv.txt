Elevator buttons morning air
Strangers silence makes want take stairs
wed laugh vacant stares
right time
Seems like theres always someone disapproves
Theyll judge like know
verdict comes nothing else
jurys choice


dont worry pretty little mind
People throw rocks things shine
life makes love look hard
stakes high waters rough
love


never know people sleeves
Ghosts past gonna jump
Lurking shadows lip gloss smiles
dont care cause right youre mine
youll say


Dont worry pretty little mind
People throw rocks things shine
life makes love look hard
stakes high waters rough
love


speculate wrong
hands tough mine belong
Ill fight doubt give faith song
Cause love gap teeth
love riddles speak
snide remarks father tattoos
ignored cause heart


dont worry pretty little mind
People throw rocks things shine
life makes love look hard
Dont worry pretty little mind
People throw rocks things shine
cant take whats
cant take whats
stakes high waters rough
love
