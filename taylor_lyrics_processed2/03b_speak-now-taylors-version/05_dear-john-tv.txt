Long nights
days revolved around
Counting footsteps
Prayin floor wont fall
mother accused losin mind
swore fine
paint blue sky
go back turn rain
lived chess game
change rules every day
Wonderin version
might get phone tonight
Well stopped pickin
song let know


Dear John see youre gone
Dont think young messed
girl dress cried whole way home
shoulda known


Well maybe blind optimism blame
maybe sick need
give love take away
youll add name long list traitors
dont understand
Ill look back regret ignored said
Run fast


Dear John see youre gone
Dont think young messed
girl dress cried whole way home
Dear John see wrong
Dont think nineteens young played
dark twisted games loved
shoulda known




expert Sorry keepin lines blurry
Never impressed acing tests
girls run dry tired lifeless eyes
Cause burned
took matches fire could catch
dont look
Im shining like fireworks sad empty town
Oh


Dear John see youre gone
Dont think young messed
girl dress cried whole way home
see youre gone
Dont think young messed
girl dress wrote song
shoulda known


shoulda known
Dont think young
shoulda known
