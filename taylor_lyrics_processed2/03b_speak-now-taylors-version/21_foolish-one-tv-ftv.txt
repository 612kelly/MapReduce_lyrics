cards table hand
Chances tonight youve already got plans
chances talk sleep
give enough attention keep hopes high
Wishful thoughts forget mention somethings really right
block voices reason head


voices say exception
never learn lesson


Foolish one
Stop checkin mailbox confessions love
aint never gonna come
take long way take long way


know keep waitin
know act like Im fine
Dont know call situation
know cant call mine
delicate best seem bulletproof
Cause head shoulder
starts thinkin youll come around
maybe someday older
something well laugh
coffee every mornin youre watching news


voices say exception
never learn lesson


Foolish one
Stop checkin mailbox confessions love
aint never gonna come
take long way take long way
Foolish one
Stop checkin mailbox confessions love
aint never gonna come
learn hard way instead walkin


Im slidin wall head hands
Sayin could see signs
Oh havent written called
goodbye screamin silence
voices head tellin
Cause got arm wings
Ill get longing glances shell get ring
say best intentions
maybe finally learn lesson


Foolish one
Stop checkin mailbox confessions love
aint never gonna come
take long way take long way
Foolish one
Stop checkin mailbox confessions love
aint never gonna come
learn hard way instead walkin ohoh oh oh


Lalalalala lalalala oh
Lalalalala
Aint never gonna come
Ooh learn hard way
Foolish one
Sittin round waiting confessions love
aint never gonna come
thinkin hes one shouldve walkin
Foolish one
day gonna come confessions love
said done wasnt one
wasnt one
