still remember look face
Lit darkness
words whispered us know
told loved go away
Away


recall smell rain
Fresh pavement ran plane
July ninth beat heart
jumps shirt still feel arms


Ill go
Sit floor wearin clothes
know dont know
somethin miss


never thought wed last kiss
never imagined wed end like
name forever name lips


remember swing step
life party youre showin
Id roll eyes youd pull
Im much dancin
love handshake meetin father
love walk hands pockets
youd kiss middle saying something
Theres day dont miss rude interruptions


Ill go
Sit floor wearin clothes
know dont know
somethin miss


never thought wed last kiss
never imagined wed end like
name forever name lips mmm


Ill watch life pictures like used watch sleep
feel forget like used feel breathe
Ill keep old friends ask
Hope nice
hope sun shines beautiful day
something reminds wish stayed
plan change weather time
never planned changing mind


Ill go
Sit floor wearin clothes
know dont know
somethin miss


never thought wed last kiss
never imagined wed end like
name forever name lips


like last kiss
Forever name lips
Forever name lips
like last
