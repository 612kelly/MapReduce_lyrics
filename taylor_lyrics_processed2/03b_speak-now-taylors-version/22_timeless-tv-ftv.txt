block theres antique shop
something head said Stop walked
counter cardboard box
sign said Photos twentyfive cents
Black white saw bride
school lovers laughin porch first house
kinda love find lifetime
kind dont put
thats called hard explain
photos saw us instead
somehow know wouldve found
another life still wouldve turned head even wd met


crowded street
wer headed fight war
still wouldve mine
would timeless
wouldve read love letters every single night
prayed God youd comin home right
wouldve fine
would timeless
Cause believe supposed find
even different life still wouldve mine
wouldve timeless


smile caught eye
one teenage couple driveway
Holdin hands way dance
date back said
brought back first time saw
Time stood still like somethin old shop
thought started lookin round
precious things time forgot
Thats came upon book covered cobwebs
Story romance torn apart fate
Hundreds years ago fell love like
Id die way first saw face


fifteen hundreds foreign land
forced marry another man
still wouldve mine
would timeless
wouldve read love letters every single night
run away left behind
still wouldve mine
wouldve timeless
Cause believe supposed find
even different life still wouldve mine
wouldve timeless


Time breaks mind body
Dont let touch soul
like ageold classic
first time saw
story started said Hello


crowded room short years ago
sometimes theres proof know
Youre always gonna mine
gonna
Im gonna love hair turnin gray
Well cardboard box photos life weve made
youll say Oh really timeless


gonna timeless timeless
still wouldve mine
wouldve
Even wed met crowded street
still wouldve mine
wouldve


block theres antique shop
somethin head said Stop walked
