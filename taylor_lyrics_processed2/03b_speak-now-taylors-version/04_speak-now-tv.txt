rudely bargin white veil occasion
kind boy
marrying wrong girl
sneak see friends
snotty little family dressed pastel
yelling bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside room
Wearin gown shaped like pastry

lose daydream

Dont wait say single vow
need hear
said Spak


Fond gestures xchanged
organ starts play song sounds like death march
hiding curtains
seems uninvited lovely bridetobe


floats aisle like pageant queen
know wish

Dont say yes run away
Ill meet youre
church back door
Dont wait say single vow
need hear
said Speak
Dont say yes run away
Ill meet youre
church back door
Dont wait say single vow

said Speak

Speak forever hold peace
Theres silence theres last chance
stand shaky hands eyes
Horrified looks everyone room
