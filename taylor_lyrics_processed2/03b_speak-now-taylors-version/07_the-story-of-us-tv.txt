used think one day wed tell story us
met sparks flew instantly
people would say Theyre lucky ones
used know place spot next
Im searchin room empty seat
Cause lately dont even know page youre


Oh simple complication
Miscommunications lead fallout
many things wish knew
many walls cant break


Im standin alone crowded room
speakin
Im dyin know killin
Like killin Yeah
dont know say since th twist fate
broke
th story us looks lot like tragedy


Next chapter


Howd end way
See nervously pulling clothes tryin look busy
youre doin best avoid
Im starting think one day Ill tell story us
losin mind saw
held pride like shouldve held


Oh Im scared see ending
pretending nothin
Id tell miss dont know
Ive never heard silence quite loud


Im standin alone crowded room
speakin
Im dyin know killin
Like killin Yeah
dont know say since twist fate
broke
story us looks lot like tragedy


looking like contest
act like care less
liked better side
battles hands
would lay armor
said youd rather love fight

many things wish knew
story us might ending soon


Im standin alone crowded room
speakin
Im dyin know killin
Like killin Yeah
dont know say since twist fate
broke
story us looks lot like tragedy
speakin

Like killin Yeah
dont know say since twist fate
Cause goin
story us looks lot like tragedy
