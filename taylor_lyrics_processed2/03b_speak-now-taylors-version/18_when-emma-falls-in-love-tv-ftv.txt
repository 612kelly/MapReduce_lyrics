Emma falls love paces floor
Closes blinds locks door
Emma falls love calls mom
Jokes ways one could go wrong
waits takes time
Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks gonna rain
Emma falls love know
boy never


Cause shes kind book cant put
Like Cleopatra grew small town
bad boys would good boys
chance love
tell truth sometimes wish


Emma falls love face
Hangs air like stars outer space
Emma falls love disappears
laugh seein years
Emma falls apart shes alone
takes pain bears
Cause Emma falls love shes keeps
wont walk away unless knows absolutely leave


shes kind book cant put
Like Cleopatra grew small town
bad boys would good boys
chance love
tell truth sometimes wish


Well shes New York shes LA
wont lose love way
Cause shell call shell put place
Emma falls love Im learning


Emma met boy eyes like man
Turns heart fits right palm hand
hell shelter rains
Little know whole worlds change


Cause shes kind book cant put
Like Cleopatra grew small town
bad boys would good boys
chance love
tell truth sometimes wish


Yeah sometimes wish
