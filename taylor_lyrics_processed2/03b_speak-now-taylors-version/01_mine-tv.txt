Ahah ahah
Ahah ahah


college working parttime waitin tables
Left small town never looked back
flight risk fear falling
Wonderin bother love never lasts


say believe
lyin couch
moment could see
Yes yes see


remember sittin water
put arm around first time
made rebel careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine


Flash forward takin world together
theres drawer things place
learn secrets figure Im guarded
say well never make parents mistakes


got bills pay
got nothing figured
hard take
Yes yes thought


remember sittin water
put arm around first time
made rebel careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine
remember city lights water
saw start believe first time
made rebel careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine


Ohoh oh


remember fight
everything slippin right hands
ran cryin followed street
Braced goodbye
Cause thats Ive ever known
took surprise
said Ill never leave alone


said remember felt sitting water
every time look like first time
fell love careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine


Hold make last
Hold never turn back
made rebel careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine


Yes yes believe
Yes yes gonna make
Yes yes see
Yes yes see
