little hands wrapped around finger
quiet world tonight
little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
tuck turn favourite nightlight


everythings funny
got nothing regret
Id give honey
could stay like


Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow stay little
Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow could stay simple
wont let nobody hurt
Wont let one break heart
one desert
try never grow


never grow


Youre car way movies
youre mortified moms droppin
fourteen theres much cant
cant wait move someday call shots


dont make drop around block
Remember shes gettin older
dont lose way dance around
PJs getting ready school


Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow stay little
Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow could stay simple
ones ever burned
Nothings ever left scarred
even though want
try never grow


Take pictures mind childhood room
Memorize sounded like dad gets home
Remember footsteps remember words said
little brothers favorite songs
realized everything someday gonna gone


new apartment
big city dropped
much colder thought would
tuck turn nightlight


Wish Id never grown
Wish Id never grown
Oh dont wanna grow
Wish Id never grown could still little
Oh dont wanna grow
Wish Id never grown could still simple
Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow stay little
Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow could stay simple
wont let nobody hurt
Wont let one break heart
even though want
Please try never grow


Oh oh
never grow
Oh
never grow
