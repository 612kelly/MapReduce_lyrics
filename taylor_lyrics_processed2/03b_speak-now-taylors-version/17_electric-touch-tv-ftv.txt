breathe relax itll okay
hour til cars driveway
first time ever hangin tonight
Ive got money things goin badly
Got history stories ending sadly
Still hoping fire wont burn
one time one time


know could either break heart bring back life
Got feelin electric touch could fill ghost town life
want wanna need forever
heat electric touch mmm


Ive left rain lost pining
Im tryin hard look like Im trying
Cause every time tried hard love fell apart
Ive gotten used one callin phone
Ive grown accustomed sleepin alone
Still know takes get right
one time one time


know could either break heart bring back life
Got feelin electric touch could fill ghost town life
want wanna need forever
heat electric touch mmm


thinking one time
Maybe stars align
maybe call mine
wont need space
string along decide
one time
Maybe moments right
see two headlights


know could either break heart bring back life
Got feelin electric touch
know could either break heart bring back life
Got feelin electric touch could fill ghost town life
want wanna need forever
heat electric touch mmm
