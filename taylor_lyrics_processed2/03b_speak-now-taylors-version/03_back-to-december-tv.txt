Im glad made time see
Hows life Tell hows family
havent seen
Youve good busier ever
small talk work weather
guard know


last time saw
still burned back mind
gave roses left die


swallowing pride
Standin front sayin Im sorry night
go back December time
turns freedom aint nothing missin
Wishin Id realized mine
go back December turn around make alright
go back December time


days havent sleeping
Stayin playing back leavin
birthday passed didnt call
think summer beautiful times
watched laughin passenger side
realized loved fall


cold came dark days
fear crept mind
gave love gave goodbye


swallowing pride
Standin front sayin Im sorry night
go back December time
turns freedom aint nothing missin
Wishin Id realized mine
go back December turn around change mind
go back December time


miss tanned skin sweet smile
good right
held arms September night
first time ever saw cry
Maybe wishful thinkin
Probably mindless dreaming
loved swear Id love right
Id go back time change cant
chain door understand


swallowing pride
Standin front sayin Im sorry night
go back December
turns freedom aint nothing missin
Wishin Id realized mine
go back December turn around make alright
go back December turn around change mind
go back December time


time
