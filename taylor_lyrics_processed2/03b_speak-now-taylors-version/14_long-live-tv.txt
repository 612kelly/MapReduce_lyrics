said Remember moment
back mind
time stood shaking hands
crowds stands went wild
kings queens
read names
night danced like knew lives would
Never
held head like hero history book page
end decade
start age


Long live walls crashd
kingdom lights shined
scraming Long live magic made
bring pretenders
One day remembered


said Remember feeling
pass pictures around
years stood sidelines
Wishin right
kings queens
traded baseball cap crown
gave us trophies
held town
cynics outraged
Screaming absurd
Cause moment band thieves
ripped jeans got rule world


Long live walls crashed
kingdom lights shined
screaming Long live magic made
bring pretenders Im afraid
Long live mountains moved
time life fighting dragons
screaming Long live look face
bring pretenders
One day remembered


Hold spinning around
Confetti falls ground
May memories break fall
take moment Promise
youll stand forever
God forbid fate step
force us goodbye
children day
point pictures
Please tell em name
Tell em crowds went wild
Tell em hope shine
Long live walls crashed
time life


Long long live walls crashed
kingdom lights shined
screaming Long live magic made
bring pretenders Im afraid
Singing Long live mountains moved
time life fighting dragons
long long live look face
bring pretenders
One day remembered
