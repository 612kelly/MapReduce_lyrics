words like knives
swords weapons use
knocked feet
Got feelin like nothing
voice like nails chalkboard
Calling Im wounded
pickin weaker man


Well take
one single blow
dont know dont know


Someday Ill livin big old city
youre ever gonna mean
Someday Ill big enough cant hit
youre ever gonna mean
gotta mean


switching sides
wildfire lies humiliation
pointed flaws
dont already see
walk head trying block
Cause Ill never impress
wanna feel okay


bet got pushed around
Somebody made cold
cycle ends right
Cause cant lead road
dont know dont know


Someday Ill livin big old city
youre ever gonna mean
Someday Ill big enough cant hit
youre ever gonna mean
gotta mean


see years bar
Talking football game
big loud opinion nobodys listening
Washed ranting old bitter things
Drunk grumbling cant sing
mean


mean
liar pathetic
alone life mean
mean mean mean


someday Ill livin big old city
youre ever gonna mean yeah
Someday Ill big enough cant hit
youre ever gonna mean
gotta mean
Someday Ill livin big old city

youre ever gonna mean

Someday Ill big enough cant hit

youre ever gonna mean
gotta mean
