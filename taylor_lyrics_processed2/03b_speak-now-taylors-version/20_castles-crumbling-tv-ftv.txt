empire golden age
held high used great
used cheer saw face
fear fallen grace


feel like castles crumbling
watch bridges burn ground
dont want know let
dont wanna know


great hope dynasty
Crowds would hang words trusted
faith strong pushed far
held grudge til tore apart


Power went head couldnt stop
Ones loved tried help ran
sit alone behind walls regret
Falling like promises never kept


feel like castles crumbling
watch bridges burn ground
dont want know let
dont wanna know


foes friends watch reign end
dont know couldve ended way
Smoke billows ships harbor
People look like Im monster
theyre screamin palaces front gates
Used chant name
theyre screaming hate
Never wanted hate


castles crumbling
watch bridges burn ground
dont want know let
castles crumbling
dont wanna know
