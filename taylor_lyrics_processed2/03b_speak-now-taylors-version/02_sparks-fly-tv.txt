way move like full rainstorm
Im house cards
Youre kind reckless send runnin
kinda know wont get far
stood front close enough touch
Close enough hope couldnt see thinkin


Drop everything meet pouring rain
Kiss sidewalk take away pain
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile
Get green eyes baby lights go
Give something thatll haunt youre around
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile


mind forgets remind youre bad idea
touch really somethin
find Im even better imagined would
Im guard rest world
know good
could wait patiently really wish would


Drop everything meet pouring rain
Kiss sidewalk take away pain
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile
Get green eyes baby lights go
Give something thatll haunt youre around
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile


run fingers hair watch lights go wild
keep keepin eyes
wrong enough make feel right
lead staircase wont whisper soft slow
Im captivated baby like fireworks show


Drop everything meet pouring rain
Kiss sidewalk take away pain
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile
Get green eyes baby lights go
Give something thatll haunt youre around
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile


sparks fly
Oh baby smile
sparks fly
