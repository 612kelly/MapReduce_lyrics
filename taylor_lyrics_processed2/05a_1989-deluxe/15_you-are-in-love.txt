One look dark room
Meant
Time moved fast play back
Buttons coat lighthearted joke
proof much saw enough
Small talk drives
Coffee midnight
light reflects chain neck
says Look
shoulders brush
proof one touch felt enough


hear silence silence
feel way home way home
see lights lights
love true love
love


Morning place
Burnt toast Sunday
keep shirt keeps word
let go
fears ghosts
One step much said enough
kiss sidewalks
fight talk
One night wakes
Strange look face
Pauses says Youre best friend
knew love


hear silence silence
feel way home way home
see lights lights
love true love


goes
two dancing snow globe round round
keeps picture office downtown
understand
lost minds fought wars
Ive spent whole life trying put words


Cause hear silence
feel way home
see lights
love true love
love


hear silence silence
feel way home way home
see lights lights
love true love
love
hear silence silence
feel way home way home
see lights lights
love true love
love
