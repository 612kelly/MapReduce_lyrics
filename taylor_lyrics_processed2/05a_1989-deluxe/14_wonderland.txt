Flashing lights
Took wrong turn
Fell rabbit hole
held tight
Cause nothings seems
spinning control


Didnt tell us dont rush things
Didnt flash green eyes
Havent heard becomes curious minds
Ooh didnt seem new exciting
felt arms twistin around
slept one eye open night


found Wonderland
got lost
pretended could last forever
found Wonderland
got lost
life never worse never better



Wonderland

Wonderland

Wonderland

Wonderland


went way
love think straight
alone seemed
strangers watching
whispers turned talking
talking turned screams oh


Didnt tell us dont rush things
Didnt flash green eyes
Didnt calm fears Cheshire cat smile
Ooh didnt seem new exciting
felt arms twistin around
fun games til somebody loses mind
darlin


found Wonderland
got lost
pretended could last forever
found Wonderland
got lost
life never worse never better



Wonderland

Wonderland

Wonderland

Whoa Wonderland


reached gone
knew go back home
searched world something else
make feel like
end Wonderland
went mad
Oh


found Wonderland
got lost
pretended could last forever
Last forever
found Wonderland
got lost
life never worse never better
Never better



found Wonderland
got lost

pretended could last forever

found Wonderland
got lost

life never worse never better
Wonderland
