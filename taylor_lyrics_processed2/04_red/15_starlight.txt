said Oh marvelous tune
best night never would forget moved
whole place dressed nines
dancing dancing
Like made starlight
Like made starlight


met Bobby boardwalk summer
Picked late one night window
crazy running wild wild
Cant remember song playing walked
night snuck yacht club party
Pretending duchess prince


said Oh marvelous tune
best night never would forget moved
whole place dressed nines
dancing dancing
Like made starlight starlight
Like made starlight starlight


said Look
Worrying much things cant change
Youll spend whole life singing blues
keep thinking way
trying skip rocks ocean saying
Dont see starlight starlight
Dont dream impossible things


Like Oh marvelous tune
best night never would forget moved
whole place dressed nines
dancing dancing
Like made starlight starlight
Like made starlight starlight


Ooh ooh hes talking crazy
Ooh ooh dancing
Ooh ooh could get married
ten kids teach em dream




Oh marvelous tune
best night never would forget moved
whole place dressed nines
dancing dancing
Like made starlight starlight
Like made starlight starlight


Like made starlight starlight
Like dream impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight
Like dream impossible dreams


Dont see starlight starlight
Dont dream impossible things
