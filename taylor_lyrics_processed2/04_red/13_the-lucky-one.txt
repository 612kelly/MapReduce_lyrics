New town made name
angels city chasing fortune fame
camera flashes make look like dream
figured since school
Everybody loves pretty everybody loves cool
overnight look like sixties queen


Another name goes lights
Like diamonds sky


theyll tell youre lucky one
Yeah theyll tell youre lucky one
tell youre lucky one
Oh oh oh


big black cars Riviera views
lover foyer doesnt even know
secrets end splashed news front page
tell youre lucky youre confused
Cause dont feel pretty feel used
young things line take place


Another name goes lights
wonder youll make alive


theyll tell youre lucky one
Yeah theyll tell youre lucky one
tell youre lucky one
Oh oh oh


years later showed
still tell legend disappeared
took money dignity got hell
say bought bunch land somewhere
Chose rose garden Madison Square
took time understand


Cause name lights
think got right


Let tell youre lucky one
Let tell youre lucky one
Let tell youre lucky one oh oh oh
theyll tell youre lucky one
Yeah theyll tell youre lucky one
theyll tell youre lucky one oh oh oh
Oh whoa oh oh
