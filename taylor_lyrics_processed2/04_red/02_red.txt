Loving like
Driving new Maserati deadend street
Faster wind passionate sin
Ending suddenly
Loving like tryin change mind
youre already flying free fall
Like colors autumn bright
lose


Losing blue like Id never known
Missing dark gray alone
Forgetting like
Tryin know somebody never met
loving red




Loving red




Touching like
Realizing ever wanted right front
Memorizing
Easy knowing words old favorite song
Fighting like
Trying solve crossword realizing theres right answer
Regretting like
Wishing never found love could strong


Losing blue like Id never known
Missing dark gray alone
Forgetting like
Tryin know somebody never met
loving red



Oh red
Burning red



Remembering comes flashbacks echoes
Tell time gotta let go
moving impossible
still see head
burning red
Burning red


Oh losing blue like Id never known
Missing dark gray alone
Forgetting like
Tryin know somebody never met
Cause loving red


Yeah yeah red
Burning red

thats hes spinning round head
Comes back burning red
Yeah yeah



love like
Driving new Maserati deadend street
