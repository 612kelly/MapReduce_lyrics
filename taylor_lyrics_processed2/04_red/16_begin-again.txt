Took deep breath mirror
didnt like wore high heels
Turn lock put headphones
always said didnt get song
Walked expecting youd late
got early stand wave
walk
pull chair help
dont know nice


throw head back laughing like little kid
think strange think Im funny cause never
Ive spending last eight months
Thinking love ever break burn end
Wednesday caf watched begin


said never met one girl
many James Taylor records
tell stories dont know
Im coming little shy


throw head back laughing like little kid
think strange think Im funny cause never
Ive spending last eight months
Thinking love ever break burn end
Wednesday caf watched begin


walked block car
almost brought
start talk movies
family watches every single Christmas
want talk
first time whats past past


Cause throw head back laughing like little kid
think strange think Im funny cause never
Ive spending last eight months
Thinking love ever break burn end
Wednesday caf watched begin
