reminiscing day
coffee alone Lord took away
Back firstglance feeling New York time
Back fit poems like perfect rhyme
Took faster green light go
Hey skip conversation already know
left note door joke wed made
first day


darling good
Never looking
right stood
holy ground


Spinning like girl brand new dress
big wide city
blocked noise sound need
first time something lose
guess fell apart usual way
storys got dust every page
sometimes wonder think
see face every crowd


Cause darling good
Never looking
right stood
holy ground


Tonight Im gonna dance
weve
dont wanna dance
Im dancing
Tonight Im gonna dance
Like room
dont wanna dance
Im dancing


good
Never looking
right stood
holy ground


Tonight Im gonna dance
weve
dont wanna dance
Im dancing
Tonight Im gonna dance
Like room
dont wanna dance
Im dancing
