Fever dream high quiet night
know caught
Bad bad boy shiny toy price
know bought


Killing slow window
Im always waiting waiting
Devils roll dice angels roll eyes
doesnt kill makes want


new shape body
blue feeling Ive got
ooh whoa oh
cruel summer
cool thats tell em
rules breakable heaven
ooh whoa oh
cruel summer



Hang head low glow vending machine
Im dying
say well screw trying times
trying


cut headlights summers knife
Im always waiting cut bone
Devils roll dice angels roll eyes
bleed youll last know


Oh new shape body
blue feeling Ive got
ooh whoa oh
cruel summer
cool thats tell em
rules breakable heaven
ooh whoa oh
cruel summer



Im drunk back car
cried like baby coming home bar
Said Im fine wasnt true
dont wanna keep secrets keep
snuck garden gate
Every night summer seal fate
scream whatever worth
love aint worst thing ever heard
looks grinning like devil


new shape body
blue feeling Ive got
ooh whoa oh
cruel summer
cool thats tell em
rules breakable heaven
ooh whoa oh
cruel summer



Im drunk back car
cried like baby coming home bar
Said Im fine wasnt true
dont wanna keep secrets keep
snuck garden gate
Every night summer seal fate
scream whatever worth
love aint worst thing ever heard
