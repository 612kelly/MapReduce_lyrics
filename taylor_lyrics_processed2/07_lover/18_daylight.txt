love cruel cities lived
Everyone looked worse light
many lines Ive crossed unforgiven
Ill tell truth never goodbye


dont wanna look anything else saw
dont wanna think anything else thought
Ive sleeping long year dark night
see daylight see daylight


Luck draw draws unlucky
became butt joke
wounded good trusted wicked
Clearing air breathed smoke
Maybe ran wolves refused settle
Maybe Ive stormed every single room town
Threw cloaks daggers morning
brighter


dont wanna look anything else saw

dont wanna think anything else thought

Ive sleeping long year dark night

see daylight see daylight
see daylight daylight daylight daylight
see daylight daylight daylight daylight


still see

believed love would
golden
still see
Back forth New York
believed love would
golden
Like daylight like daylight
Like daylight daylight


dont wanna look anything else saw

dont wanna think anything else thought

Ive sleeping long year dark night

see daylight see daylight
see daylight daylight daylight daylight
see daylight daylight daylight daylight

see daylight daylight daylight daylight

see daylight daylight daylight daylight



Like daylight
golden like daylight
gotta step daylight let go
let go let go


wanna defined things love
things hate
things Im afraid Im afraid
things haunt middle night
think
love
