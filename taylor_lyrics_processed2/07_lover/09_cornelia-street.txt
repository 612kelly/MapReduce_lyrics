backseat
Drunk something stronger drinks bar
rent place Cornelia Street
say casually car
fresh page desk
Filling blanks go
street lights pointed arrow head
Leading us home


hope never lose hope never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street
Thats kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street
baby get mystified city screams name
baby Im terrified ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street
Id never walk Cornelia Street


Windows flung right open autumn air
Jacket round shoulders
bless rains Cornelia Street
Memorize creaks floor
Back card sharks playing games
thought leading
packed bags left Cornelia Street
even knew gone


called showed hand
turned around hit tunnel
Sat roof


hope never lose hope never ends
Id never walk Cornelia Street
Thats kinda heartbreak time could never mend
Id never walk Cornelia Street
baby get mystified city screams name
baby Im terrified ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street
Id never walk Cornelia Street


hold hand street
Walk back apartment
Years ago inside
Barefoot kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
became religion listen


hope never lose
Id never walk Cornelia Street
Oh never
baby get mystified city screams name
baby Im terrified ever walk away
Id never walk Cornelia Street
Id never walk Cornelia Street


dont wanna lose
Id never walk Cornelia Street
dont wanna lose


rent place Cornelia Street
say casually car
