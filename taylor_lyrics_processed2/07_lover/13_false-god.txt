crazy think
Crazy think could work
Remember said Id die
stupid jump
ocean separating us
Remember Id fly


cant talk youre like
Staring window like Im favorite town
Im New York City
still babe
warned us times like
say road gets hard get lost
youre led blind faith blind faith


might get away
Religions lips
Even false god
Wed still worship
might get away
altar hips
Even false god
Wed still worship love
Wed still worship love
Wed still worship love


know heavens thing
go touch honey
Hell fight
patch good
Make confessions begging forgiveness
Got wine


cant talk Im like
Daring leave try scare
Youre West Village
still babe
warned us times like
say road gets hard get lost
youre led blind faith blind faith


might get away
Religions lips
Even false god
Wed still worship
might get away
altar hips
Even false god
Wed still worship love
Wed still worship love
Wed still worship love ah


Still worship love
Even false god
Even false god
Still worship love
