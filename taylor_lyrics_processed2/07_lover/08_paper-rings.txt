moon high
Like friends night first met
Went home tried stalk internet
Ive read books beside bed
wine cold
Like shoulder gave street
Cat mouse month two three
wake night watch breathe



Kiss cause know long night
Kiss twice cause gonna alright
Three times cause waited whole life


like shiny things Id marry paper rings
Uh huh thats right
Darling youre one want
hate accidents except went friends
Uh huh thats right
Darling youre one want
paper rings picture frames dirty dreams
Oh youre one want


winter icy outdoor pool
jumped first went
Im even makes blue
takes back
color painted brothers wall
Honey without exes fights flaws
wouldnt standing tall



Kiss cause know long night
Kiss twice cause gonna alright
Three times cause waited whole life
Ah


like shiny things Id marry paper rings
Uh huh thats right
Darling youre one want
hate accidents except went friends
Uh huh thats right
Darling youre one want
paper rings picture frames dirty dreams
Oh youre one want


want drive away
want complications
want dreary Mondays
Wrap arms around baby boy
want drive away
want complications
want dreary Mondays
Wrap arms around baby boy
Uh huh


like shiny things Id marry paper rings
Ahah thats right youre one want
hate accidents except went friends
Ahah darling youre one want
like shiny things Id marry paper rings
Uh huh thats right
Darling youre one want
hate accidents except went friends
Uh huh thats right

Oh youre one want


Youre one want one want
