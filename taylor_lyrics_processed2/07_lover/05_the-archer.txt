Combat Im ready combat
say dont want
Cause cruelty wins movies
Ive got hundred thrownout speeches almost said


Easy come easy go
jump train ride alone
never grew getting old
Help hold


Ive archer Ive prey
could ever leave darling
could stay


Dark side search dark side
Im alright right right right
cut nose spite face
hate reflection years years


wake night pace like ghost
room fire invisible smoke
heroes die alone
Help hold


Ive archer Ive prey
Screaming could ever leave darling
could stay



Cause see right
see right
see right
see right
see right
see right
see right
see right


kings horses kings men
Couldnt put together
Cause enemies started friends
Help hold


Ive archer Ive prey
could ever leave darling
could stay

could stay
could stay
could stay
could stay
could stay


Combat Im ready combat
