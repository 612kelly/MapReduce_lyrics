know adore Im crazier
lost film scene
Waving homecoming queens marching band playing
Im lost lights
American glory faded
Im feeling hopeless ripped prom dress
Running rose thorns saw scoreboard
ran life


cameras catch pageant smile
counted days counted miles
see see
long time coming


thats whole world
whisper hallway Shes bad bad girl
whole school rolling fake dice
play stupid games win stupid prizes
theres nothing like
Miss Americana Heartbreak Prince
sad paint town blue
Voted likely run away


team losing battered bruising
see high fives bad guys
Leave head hung one
seems care
American stories burning
Im feeling helpless damsels depressed
Boys boys wise men
Darling Im scared


cameras catch muffled cries
counted days counted miles
see see
storm coming


thats whole world
whisper hallway Shes bad bad girl
whole school rolling fake dice
play stupid games win stupid prizes
theres nothing like
Miss Americana Heartbreak Prince
sad paint town blue
Voted likely run away


dont want dont really wanna
Cause nobodys gonna think come home
dont want dont really wanna
Cause nobodys gonna think come home
dont want dont really wanna
Cause nobodys gonna thought know
Ill never let cause know
someday gonna


thats whole world
whisper hallway Shes bad bad girl
Oh thought know
theres nothing like
Miss Americana Heartbreak Prince
sad paint town blue
Voted likely run away


dont want dont really wanna
Cause nobodys gonna think come home
Ill never let cause know
someday gonna thought know


thats whole world
whisper hallway Shes bad bad girl
Shes bad bad girl
