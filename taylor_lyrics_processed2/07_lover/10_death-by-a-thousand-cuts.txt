Saying goodbye death thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking
get drunk enough
Cause morning comes youre baby
look windows love
Even though boarded
Chandeliers still flickering
Cause cant pretend okay
death thousand cuts


dress kill time take long way home
ask traffic lights itll alright
say dont know
ones
see everywhere thing share
small town
said great love one ages
storys still writing pages


Cause saying goodbye death thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking
get drunk enough
Cause morning comes youre baby
look windows love
Even though boarded
Chandeliers still flickering
Cause cant pretend okay
death thousand cuts


heart hips body love
Tryna find part didnt touch
Gave like bad drug
Im searching signs haunted club
songs films united stand
country guess lawless land
Quiet fears touch hand
Paper cut stings paperthin plans
time wine spirit trust
Tryna find part didnt take
Gave much wasnt enough
Ill alright thousand cuts


get drunk enough
Cause youre baby
look windows love
Even though boarded
Chandeliers still flickering
Cause cant pretend okay

death thousand cuts


Tryna find part didnt touch
body love trust
wasnt enough wasnt enough


take long way home
ask traffic lights itll alright
say dont know
