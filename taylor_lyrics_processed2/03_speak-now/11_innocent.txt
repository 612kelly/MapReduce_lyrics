guess really time
Left war path
Lost balance tightrope
Lost mind trying get back


Wasnt easier lunchbox days
Always bigger bed crawl
Wasnt beautiful believed everything
everybody believed


alright wait see
string lights still bright
Oh youve
Youre still innocent youre still innocent


things cant speak
night live
wouldnt shattered floor
seen know


Wasnt easier fireflycatching days
everything reach
Someone bigger brought
Wasnt beautiful running wild til fell asleep
monsters caught


alright wait see
string lights still bright
Oh youve
Youre still innocent
okay life tough crowd
still growing

Youre still innocent


Time turns flames embers
Youll new Septembers
Every one us messed
Lives change like weather
hope remember
Today never late brand new oh


alright wait see
string lights still bright
Oh youve
Youre still innocent
okay life tough crowd
still growing

Youre still innocent youre still innocent


Lost balance tightrope oh
never late get back
