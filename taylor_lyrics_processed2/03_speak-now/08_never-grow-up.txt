little hands wrapped around finger
quiet world tonight
little eyelids flutter cause youre dreaming
tuck turn favorite night light
everythings funny got nothing regret
Id give honey
could stay like


Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow stay little
Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow could stay simple
wont let nobody hurt wont let one break heart
one desert
try never grow never grow


Youre car way movies
youre mortified moms dropping
fourteen theres much cant
cant wait move someday call shots
dont make drop around block
Remember shes getting older
dont lose way dance around pjs getting ready school


Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow stay little
Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow could stay simple
ones ever burned nothings ever left scarred
even though want try never grow


Take pictures mind childhood room
Memorize sounded like dad gets home
Remember footsteps remember words said
little brothers favorite songs
realized everything someday gonna gone
new apartment
big city dropped
much colder thought would
tuck turn night light
Wish Id never grown
wish Id never grown


Oh dont wanna grow wish Id never grown
could still little
Oh dont wanna grow wish Id never grown
could still simple
Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow stay little
Oh darling dont ever grow
Dont ever grow could stay simple
Wont let nobody hurt
Wont let one break heart
even though want please try never grow
Oh dont ever grow
Oh never grow never grow
