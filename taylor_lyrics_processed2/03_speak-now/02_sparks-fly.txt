way move like full rainstorm
Im house cards
Youre kind reckless
send running
kinda know wont get far
stood front
close enough touch
Close enough hope couldnt see
thinking


Drop everything
Meet pouring rain
Kiss sidewalk
Take away pain
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile
Get green eyes baby lights go
Give something thatll haunt youre around
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile


mind forgets remind
Youre bad idea
touch really something
find Im even better imagined would
Im guard rest world
know good
could wait patiently really wish would


Drop everything
Meet pouring rain
Kiss sidewalk
Take away pain
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile
Get green eyes baby lights go
Give something thatll haunt youre around
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile


run fingers hair watch lights go wild
keep keeping eyes
wrong enough make feel right
lead staircase
Wont whisper soft slow
Im captivated baby like firework show


Drop everything
Meet pouring rain
Kiss sidewalk
Take away pain
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile
Get green eyes baby lights go
Give something thatll haunt youre around
Cause see sparks fly whenever smile


sparks fly
Oh baby smile
sparks fly
