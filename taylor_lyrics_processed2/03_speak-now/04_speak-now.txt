kind girl
rudely barging
white veil occasion
kind boy
marrying wrong girl


sneak see friends
snotty little family
dressed pastel
yelling bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside room
Wearing gown shaped like pastry


surely
thought would
lose daydream
stand say


Dont say yes run away
Ill meet youre
church back door
Dont wait say single vow
need hear
said speak


Fond gestures exchanged
organ starts play
song sounds like death march
hiding curtains
seems uninvited
lovely bridetobe


floats aisle
Like pageant queen
know wish
wish


Dont say yes run away
Ill meet youre
church back door
Dont wait say single vow
need hear
said speak
Dont say yes run away
Ill meet youre
church back door
Dont wait say single vow
time running
said speak


Ooh ladadada oh
Ooh ooh



hear preacher say
Speak forever hold peace
Theres silence theres last chance
stand shaking hands eyes
Horrified looks everyone room
Im looking


kind girl
rudely barging
white veil occasion
kind boy
marrying wrong girl



dont say yes run away
Ill meet youre
church back door
Dont wait say single vow
need hear
said speak
say
Lets run away
Ill meet
Im tux back door
Baby didnt say vows
glad around said
Speak
