Long nights
days revolved around
Counting footsteps
Praying floor wont fall
mother accused losing mind
swore fine
paint blue sky
go back turn rain
lived chess game
changed rules everyday
Wonderin version might get phone tonight
Well stopped pickin song let know


Dear John see youre gone
Dont think young messed
girl dress cried whole way home
shoulda known


Well maybe
blind optimism blame
maybe sick need
give love take away
youll add name long list traitors
dont understand
look back regret ignored said
Run fast


Dear John see youre gone
Dont think young messed
girl dress cried whole way home
Dear John see wrong
Dont think nineteens young
played dark twisted games
loved
shoulda known


expert sorry
keeping lines blurry
Never impressed acing tests
girls youve run dry tired lifeless eyes
Cause burned
took matches
fire could catch
dont look
Im shining like fireworks
sad empty town yeah
Oh oh oh oh oh oh


Dear John see youre gone
Dont think young messed
girl dress cried whole way home
see youre gone
Dont think young messed
girl dress wrote song
shoulda known


shoulda known
Dont think young
shoulda known
