walk fragile line
known time
never thought Id live see break
getting dark quiet
cant trust anything
coming like big mistake


Whoa holding breath
Wont lose
Somethings made eyes go cold


Come come dont leave like
thought figured
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre wanted
Come come dont leave like
thought figured
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back Im haunted


Stood watched walk away
everything
still mean every word said
try take away pain
might make smile
whole time Im wishing instead


Oh holding breath
Wont see
Something keeps holding onto nothing


Come come dont leave like
thought figured
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Youre wanted
Come come dont leave like
thought figured
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant turn back Im haunted


know
know
know
Youre gone cant gone


Come come dont leave like
thought figured
Somethings gone terribly wrong
Wont finish started
Come come dont leave like
thought figured
Cant breathe whenever youre gone
Cant go back Im haunted



walk fragile line
known time
Never ever thought Id see break
Never thought Id see
