still remember look face
Lit darkness
words whispered
us know
told loved
go away
Away


recall smell rain
Fresh pavement
ran plane
July th
beat heart
jumps shirt
still feel arms


Ill go sit floor
Wearing clothes
know
dont know something miss
never thought wed last kiss
Never imagined wed end like
name forever name lips


remember swing step
life party youre showing
roll eyes
pull
Im much dancing



love handshake meeting father
love walk hands pockets
youd kiss middle saying something
Theres day dont miss rude interruptions


Ill go sit floor
Wearing clothes
know
dont know something miss
never thought wed last kiss
never imagined wed end like
name forever name lips ooh


Ill watch life pictures like used watch sleep
feel forget like used feel breathe
keep old friends ask
Hope nice
hope sun shines
beautiful day
something reminds
wish stayed
plan change weather time
never planned changing mind


Ill go sit floor
Wearing clothes
know
dont know something miss
never thought wed last kiss
Never imagined wed end like
name forever name lips
like last kiss
Forever name lips
Forever name lips


like last
