college working parttime waiting tables
Left small town never looked back
flight risk fear falling
Wondering bother love never lasts


say believe
lying couch
moment could see
Yes yes see


remember sitting water
put arm around first time
made rebel careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine


Flash forward taking world together
theres drawer things place
learn secrets figure Im guarded
say well never make parents mistakes


got bills pay
got nothing figured
hard take
Yes yes
thought


remember sitting water
put arm around first time
made rebel careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine

remember city lights water
saw start believe first time
made rebel careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine


remember fight
everything slipping right hands
ran crying followed street
Braced goodbye
Cause thats Ive ever known
took surprise
said Ill never leave alone


said remember felt sitting water
every time look like first time
fell love careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine
Hold make last
Hold never turn back
made rebel careless mans careful daughter
best thing thats ever mine


Yeah yeah
believe
gonna make
see
Yeah yeah
