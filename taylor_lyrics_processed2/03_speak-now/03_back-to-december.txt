Im glad made time see
Hows life Tell hows family
havent seen
Youve good busier ever
small talk work weather
guard know


last time saw
still burned back mind
gave roses left die


swallowing pride
Standing front saying Im sorry night
go back December time
turns freedom aint nothing missing
Wishing Id realized mine
Id go back December turn around make alright
go back December time


days havent sleeping
Staying playing back leaving
birthday passed didnt call
think summer beautiful times
watched laughing passenger side
Realized loved fall


cold came
dark days fear crept mind
gave love gave goodbye


swallowing pride
Standing front saying Im sorry night
go back December time
turns freedom aint nothing missing
Wishing Id realized mine
Id go back December turn around change mind
go back December time


miss tan skin sweet smile
good right
held arms September night
first time ever saw cry
Maybe wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
loved swear Id love right
Id go back time change cant
chain door understand


swallowing pride
Standing front saying Im sorry night
go back December
turns freedom aint nothing missing
Wishing Id realized mine
Id go back December turn around make alright
Id go back December turn around change mind
go back December time
time
