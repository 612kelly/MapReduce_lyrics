used think one day wed tell story us
met sparks flew instantly
people would say theyre lucky ones
used know place spot next
Im searching room empty seat
Cause lately dont even know page youre


Oh simple complication
Miscommunications lead fallout
many things wish knew
many walls cant break


Im standing alone crowded room
speaking
Im dying know
killing like killing
Yeah dont know say
Since twist fate broke
story us looks lot like tragedy
Next chapter


Howd end way
See nervously pulling clothes trying look busy
youre best avoid
Im starting think one day Ill tell story us
losing mind saw
held pride like shouldve held


Oh Im scared see ending
pretending nothing
Id tell miss dont know
Ive never heard silence quite loud


Im standing alone crowded room
speaking
Im dying know
killing like killing
Yeah dont know say
Since twist fate broke
story us looks lot like tragedy


looking like contest
act like care less
liked better side
battles hands
would lay armor
say youd rather love fight
many things wish knew
story us might ending soon


Im standing alone crowded room
speaking
Im dying know
killing like killing
Yeah dont know say
Since twist fate broke
story us looks lot like tragedy


speaking
Im dying know
killing like killing yeah
dont know say since twist fate
Cause going
story us looks lot like tragedy
End
