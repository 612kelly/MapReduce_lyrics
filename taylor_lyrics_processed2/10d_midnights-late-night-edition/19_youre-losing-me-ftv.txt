say dont understand say know dont
thought cure would come time fear wont
Remember lookin room loved cause light
sit dark wonder time


throw everything built keep
Im getting tired even phoenix
Always risin ashes
Mendin gashes
might dealt final blow


Stop youre losing
Stop youre losing
Stop youre losing
cant find pulse
heart wont start anymore
Cause youre losing


Every mornin glared storms eyes
say love someone cant tell dyin
sent signals bit nails quick
face gray wouldnt admit sick


air thick loss indecision
know pain imposition
youre running hallway
know say
dont know got gone


Stop youre losing
Stop youre losing
Stop youre losing
cant find pulse
heart wont start anymore
Cause youre losing
Cause youre losing
Stop cause youre losing


heart wont start anymore
heart wont start anymore


long could sad song
Til far gone bring back life
gave best mes endless empathy
bleed tried bravest soldier
Fighting army frontlines dont ignore
Im best thing party
wouldnt marry either
pathological people pleaser
wanted see
Im fading thinkin
something babe say something
Lose something babe risk something
Choose something babe got nothing
believe unless youre choosing


Youre losing
Stop youre losing
Stop youre losing
cant find pulse heart wont start anymore
