spy little tired eye
Tiny firefly pebble
picked last July
deep inside pocket
almost forgot
ever miss Wicklow sometimes
Ooh ooh


said end coming
Everyones something
found arunning home sweet nothings
Outside theyre push shoving
Youre kitchen humming
ever wanted sweet nothing


way home
wrote poem
say mind
happens time
Ooh ooh


Caus said end coming
Evryones something
found arunning home sweet nothings
Outside theyre push shoving
Youre kitchen humming
ever wanted nothing


Industry disruptors soul deconstructors
smoothtalking hucksters gladhanding
voices implore
cant admit Im soft
Ooh


said end coming
Everyones something
found arunning home sweet nothings
Outside theyre push shoving
Youre kitchen humming
ever wanted sweet nothing
said end coming

Everyones something

found arunning home sweet nothings
Outside theyre push shoving

Youre kitchen humming

ever wanted sweet nothing
