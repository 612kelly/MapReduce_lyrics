thing get older never wiser
Midnights become afternoons
depression works graveyard shift people
Ive ghosted stand room


left devices
come prices vices
end crisis

wake screaming dreaming
One day Ill watch youre leaving
Cause got tired scheming



hi
Im problem
teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly sun never mirror
must exhausting always rooting antihero


Sometimes feel like everybody sexy baby
Im monster hill
big hang slowly lurching toward favorite city
Pierced heart never killed


hear covert narcissism disguise altruism
Like kind congressman

wake screaming dreaming
One day Ill watch youre leaving
life lose meaning



hi
Im problem
teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly sun never mirror
must exhausting always rooting antihero


dream daughterinlaw kills money
thinks left
family gathers around reads
someone screams
Shes laughing us hell


hi
Im problem
hi
Im problem
hi
Everybody agrees everybody agrees


hi
Im problem
teatime everybody agrees
Ill stare directly sun never mirror
must exhausting always rooting antihero
