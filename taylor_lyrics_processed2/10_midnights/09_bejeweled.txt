Baby love think Ive little kind
Didnt notice walkin peace mind
shoes gave present
Puttin someone first works youre top five
way Im goin tonight


Best believe Im still bejeweled
walk room
still make whole place shimmer
meet band
ask man
could still say dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
put basement
Whn want penthouse heart
Diamonds eyes
polish real polish real nice


Nice


Baby boy think Ive good girl
extra credit got graded curve

Best believe Im still bejeweled
walk room
still make whole place shimmer
meet band
ask man
could still say dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
put basement
want penthouse heart
Diamonds eyes
polish real polish real nice


Nice


Sapphire tears face
Sadness became whole sky
guy said auras moonstone

danced night
try change mind

Whats girl gonna

Best believe Im still bejeweled
walk room
still make whole place shimmer
meet band
ask man
could still say dont remember
Familiarity breeds contempt
put basement
want penthouse heart
Diamonds eyes
polish real polish real nice


danced night
try change mind
might wait line
Whats girl gonna Whats girl gonna
polish nice
Best believe Im still bejeweled
walk room
still make whole place shimmer
