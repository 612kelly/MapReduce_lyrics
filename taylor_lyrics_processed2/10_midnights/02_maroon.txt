morning came
cleaning incense vinyl shelf
Cause lost track time
Laughing feet lap
Like closest friend
Howd end floor anyway say
roommates cheapass screwtop ros thats
see every day


chose
one dancing
New York shoes
Looked sky
burgundy tshirt
splashed wine
blood rushed cheeks
scarlet
mark thy saw collarbone
rust grew btween telephones
lips used call home
scarlet maroon


silence came
shaking blind hazy
hell lose sight us
Sobbing head hands
Aint way shit always ends
standing holloweyed hallway
Carnations thought roses thats us
feel matter
rubies gave


lost
one dancing
New York shoes
Looked sky
burgundy tshirt
splashed wine
blood rushed cheeks
scarlet
mark saw collarbone
rust grew telephones
lips used call home
scarlet maroon


wake memory
Thats real fucking legacy legacy
wake memory
Thats real fucking legacy leave


burgundy tshirt
splashed wine
blood rushed cheeks
scarlet maroon
mark saw collarbone
rust grew telephones
lips used call home
scarlet maroon


maroon
maroon
