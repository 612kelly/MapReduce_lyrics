Summer went away still yearning stays
play cool best
wait patiently hes gonna notice
okay best friends
Anyway
hear voice youre smoking boys
touch phone face
didnt choose town dream getting
Theres one could make stay
days


sprinkler splashes fireplace ashes
waited ages see
search party better bodies
learn never cared


Youre kid
always


see great escape long Daisy May
picked petals loves
Something different bloomed writing room
play songs parking lot
Ill run away


sprinkler splashes fireplace ashes
called taxi take
search party better bodies
learn dreams arent rare


Youre kid
always




sprinkler splashes fireplace ashes
gave blood sweat tears
hosted parties starved body
Like Id saved perfect kiss
jokes werent funny took money
friends home dont know say
looked around bloodsoaked gown
saw something cant take away
Cause pages turned bridges burned
Everything lose step take
make friendship bracelets take moment taste
Youve got reason afraid


Youre kid
Yeah face
Youre kid
always
