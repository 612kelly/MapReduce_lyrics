upon time planets fates
stars aligned
ended room
time


touch hand lit fuse
chain reaction countermoves
assess equation
Checkmate couldnt lose


told none accidental
first night saw
Nothing gonna stop
laid groundwork
like clockwork
dominoes cascaded line
told Im mastermind
youre min

see th wisest women
way
Cause born pawn
every lovers game


fail plan plan fail
Strategy sets scene tale
Im wind freeflowing sails
liquor cocktails


told none accidental
first night saw
knew wanted body
laid groundwork
like clockwork
dominoes cascaded line
told Im mastermind
youre mine
design
Cause Im mastermind


one wanted play little kid
Ive scheming like criminal ever since
make love make seem effortless
first time Ive felt need confess
swear
Im cryptic Machiavellian
Cause care


told none accidental
first night saw
Nothing gonna stop
laid groundwork
Saw wide smirk face
knew entire time
knew Im mastermind
youre mine
Yeah smile
Cause Im mastermind
