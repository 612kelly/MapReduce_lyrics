Draw cat eye sharp enough kill man
bad things Im worst
Sometimes wonder onell last lie
say looks kill might try
dont dress women
dont dress men
Lately Ive dressin revenge


dont start shit tell ends
Dont get sad get even
weekends
dont dress friends
Lately Ive dressin revenge


needed cold hard proof gave
envelope think got
gets house gets kids gets pride
Picture thick thieves exwife
looks pretty
Drivin Benz
Lately shes dressin revenge


dont start shit tell ends
Dont get sad get even
weekends
dont dress friends
Lately shes dressing revenge


Ladies always rise
Ladies know people want
Someone sweet kind fun
lady simply enough


Well doin lines crossin mine
Someone told white collar crimes FBI
dont dress villains
innocents
vigilante shit


dont start shit tell ends
Dont get sad get even
weekends
dont dress friends
Lately Ive dressin revenge
