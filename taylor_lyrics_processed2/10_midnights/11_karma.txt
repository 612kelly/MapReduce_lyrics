Youre talking shit hell
Addicted betrayal youre relevant
Youre terrified look
Cause dare youll see glare

Sweet like honey karma cat
Purring lap cause loves
Flexing like goddamn acrobat

Spider boy king thieves
Weave little webs opacity
pennies made crown
Trick trick twice
Dont know cash aint price

Karma breeze hair weekend
Karmas relaxing thought
Arent envious
Sweet like honey karma cat
Purring lap cause loves
Flexing like goddamn acrobat

Ask learned years
Ask earned tears
Ask many fade Im still



Cause karma thunder
Rattling ground
Karmas scent like bounty hunter
Karmas gonna track
Step step town town
Sweet like justice karma queen
Karma takes friends summit
Karma guy screen
Coming straight home


Cause karma boyfriend

Sweet like honey karma cat
Purring lap cause loves
Flexing like goddamn acrobat
