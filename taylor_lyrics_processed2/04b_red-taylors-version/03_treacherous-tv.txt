Put lips close mine
long dont touch
focus eye eye
Til gravitys much
Ill anything say
say hands
Id smart walk away
youre quicksand


slope treacherous
path reckless
slope treacherous
III like


cant decide choice
Getting swept away
hear sound voice
Asking stay
skin bone
Trained get along
Forever going flow
youre friction


slope treacherous
path reckless
slope treacherous
like


Two headlights shine sleepless night
get get alone
name echoed mind
think think know
nothing safe worth drive
would follow follow home
Ill follow follow home


hope treacherous
daydream dangerous
hope treacherous
III III III


Two headlights shine sleepless night
get get alone
name echoed mind
think think know
nothing safe worth drive
would follow follow home
Ill follow follow home
Ill follow follow home
Ill follow follow home


slope treacherous
