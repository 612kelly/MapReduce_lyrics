Loving like driving new Maserati deadend street
Faster wind passionate sin ending suddenly
Loving like trying change mind youre already flying free fall
Like colors autumn bright lose


Losing blue like Id never known
Missing dark gray alone
Forgetting like trying know somebody never met
loving red






loving red






Touching like
Realizing ever wanted right front
Memorizing
Easy knowing words old favorite song
Fighting like
Trying solve crossword realizing theres right answer
Regretting like
Wishing never found love could strong


Losing blue like Id never known
Missing dark gray alone
Forgetting like
Trying know somebody never met
loving red




Oh red

Burning red





Remembering comes flashbacks echoes
Tell time gotta let go
moving impossible
still see head
burning red
Loving red


Oh losing blue like Id never known
Missing dark gray alone
Forgetting like trying know somebody never met
Cause loving red



Yeah yeah red

Burning red



thats hes spinning round head
Comes back burning red
Yeah yeah



love like driving new Maserati deadend street
