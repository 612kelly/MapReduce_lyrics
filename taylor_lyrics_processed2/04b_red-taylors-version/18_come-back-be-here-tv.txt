said simple way
second day
strange dont know
Stumbled long goodbye
One last kiss catch flight
Right fall


told dont get attached
mind play back
Spinning faster plane took


feeling sinks
dont wanna miss like
Come back come back
guess youre New York today
dont wanna need way
Come back come back


delicate beginning rush
feeling know much
Without knowing anything
put
known know
never wouldve played nonchalant


Taxi cabs busy streets
never bring back
cant help wish took


feeling sinks
dont wanna miss like
Come back come back
guess youre London today
dont wanna need way
Come back come back


falling love cruelest way
falling worlds away
New York
youre London break
Cause fair youre around


feeling sinks
dont wanna miss like
Come back come back
guess youre New York today
dont wanna need way
Come back come back


Ohoh ohoh
dont wanna miss like
Ohoh ohoh
Come back
Come back
