wish could fly
Id pick wed go back time
Id write sky
miss like first night


goes
Every weekend party
never go alone
dont seem broken hearted
friends say know
Everything Im going
drive different roads
lead back
Cause dont know night hotel
werent riding car fell
Didnt read note Polaroid picture
dont know much miss


wish could fly
Id pick wed go back time
write sky
miss like first night



never saw coming
trying fall love
like children running
Back didnt know
built fall apart
broke status quo
broke others hearts
dont forget night LA
Dance kitchen chase hallway
one knows words whisper
one knows much miss


wish could fly
Id pick wed go back time
write sky
miss like first night


Take away
Take away
Take away

Take away
Take away
Take away



remember night hotel
riding car fell
Im one phone whisper
know much miss


wish could go back time
Id say
miss like first night


wish could fly
Id pick wed go back time
write sky
miss like first night


Take away
Take away
Take away

Take away
Take away
Take away
