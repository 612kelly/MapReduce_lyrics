Im still awake Ill bet youre fine
Fast asleep city thats better mine
girl bed fine pedigree
Ill bet friends tell shes better huh


Well tried fit uppercrust circles
Yeah let sit back love
Oh sit around talkin meaning life
book saved em hadnt heard


done
bet couldnt believe
realized Im harder forget leave
bet think


grew silverspoon gated community
Glamorous shiny bright Beverly Hills
raised farm wasnt mansion
livin room dancin kitchen table bills


know say cant help fall
fell like early spring snow
reality crept said different
laughed dreams rolled eyes jokes


Mr Superior Thinkin
space need
dont shrink know youll never happy
bet think


bet think yes
bet think


Oh block
voices loud sayin
let go
make feel sad
love youre lookin

youre world searchin soul
Scared hip scared get old
Chasing makebelieve status last time felt free
none shit mattered cause


done
bet hard believe
turned Im harder forget leave
yeah bet think


bet think yes
bet think


bet think youre
cool indie music concerts every week
bet think house
organic shoes milliondollar couch
bet think say
Oh god shes insane wrote song
bet think
