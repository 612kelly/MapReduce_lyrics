said Oh marvelous tune
best night
Never would forget moved
whole place dressed nines
dancing dancing
Like made starlight
Like made starlight


met Bobby boardwalk summer
Picks late one night
window seventeen crazy running wild wild
Cant remember song playing walked
night snuck yacht club party
Pretending duchess prince


said Oh marvelous tune
best night never would forget moved
whole place dressed nines
dancing dancing
Like made starlight starlight
Like made starlight starlight


said Look worrying much things cant change
Youll spend whole life singing blues keep thinking way
trying skip rocks ocean saying
Dont see starlight starlight
Dont dream impossible things


Like Oh marvelous tune
best night never would forget moved
whole place dressed nines
dancing dancing
Like made starlight starlight
Like made starlight starlight


Oohooh hes talking crazy
Oohooh dancing
Oohooh could get married
ten kids teach em dream








Oh marvelous tune
best night never would forget moved
whole place dressed nines
dancing dancing
Like made starlight starlight
Like made starlight starlight


Like made starlight starlight
Like dream impossible dreams
Like starlight starlight
Like dream impossible dreams


Dont see starlight starlight
Dont dream impossible things
