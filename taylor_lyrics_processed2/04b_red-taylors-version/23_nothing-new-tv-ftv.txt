tell youre young
Girls go fun
hunt slay ones actually
Criticize way fly
youre soaring sky
Shoot sigh
say looks like shes
Lord become
Ive lost novelty


Ive much drink tonight
know sad think
wake middle night
like feel time moving
person know everything eighteen
nothing twentytwo
still want Im nothing new


long cute crying room
cant blame youth
roll eyes affection
cheeks growing tired
turning red faking smiles
buying time til lose attention
someone else lights room
People love ingnue


Ive much drink tonight
go growing breaking
wake middle night
like feel time moving
person know everything eighteen
nothing twentytwo
still want Im nothing new


know someday Im gonna meet
fever dream
kind radiance seventeen
Shell know way shell say got map
Ill say Im happy Ill cry sleep
Oh woah oh woah oh oh


Ive much drink tonight
wonder theyll miss drive
wake middle night
feel time moving
person know everything eighteen
nothing twentytwo
still want still want
still want Im nothing new
