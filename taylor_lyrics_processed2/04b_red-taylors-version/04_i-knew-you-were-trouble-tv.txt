upon time mistakes ago
sights got alone
found found found
guess didnt care guess liked
fell hard took step back
Without without without


hes long gone hes next
realize blame


Cause knew trouble walked
shame
Flew places Id never
Til put oh
knew trouble walked
shame
Flew places Id never
Im lying cold hard ground


Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble

apologies hell never see cry
Pretends doesnt know hes reason
Youre drowning youre drowning youre drowning
heard moved whispers street
new notch belt Ill ever
see see see


long gone met
realize joke hey


knew trouble walked
shame
Flew places Id never
Til put oh
knew trouble walked
shame
Flew places Id never
Im lying cold hard ground


Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble


saddest fear
Comes creeping

knew trouble walked
shame
Flew places Id never
Til put oh
knew trouble walked
shame
Flew places Id never
Im lying cold hard ground


Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble
Oh ohoh
Trouble trouble trouble
knew trouble walked
Trouble trouble trouble
knew trouble walked
Trouble trouble trouble
