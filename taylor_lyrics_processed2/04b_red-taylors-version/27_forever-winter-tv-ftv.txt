says doesnt believe anything much hears days
says fall love watch go away
spends nights wishing used
spends flights getting pulled gravity
call checking
Hes pacing
says phase Im
voice comes begging


time didnt know
breaking
Id fall pieces floor
werent around
young know gets better
Ill summer sun forever
Forever winter go


seems fine time
Forcing smiles never minds
laugh symphony
lights go hard breathe
pull every thread trying solve puzzles head
Live life scared death hell decide leave instead
call checking
Hes wasted
Long gone even listening
voice comes screaming


time didnt know
breaking
Id fall pieces floor
werent around
young know gets better
Ill summer sun forever
Forever winter go


standing apartment
Id take bomb head disarm
Id say love even darkest
Please dont go


didnt know
breaking
Id fall pieces floor
werent around
young know gets better
Ill summer sun forever
Forever winter go


Ill summer sun forever
pacing
time didnt know
wasted
Id pieces floor
Forever winter go


says doesnt believe anything much hears days
say Believe one thing wont go away
