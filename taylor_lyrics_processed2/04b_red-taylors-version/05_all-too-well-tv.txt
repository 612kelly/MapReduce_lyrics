walked door air cold
something bout felt like home somehow
left scarf sisters house
youve still got drawer even


Oh sweet disposition wideeyed gaze
singing car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling like pieces place
picture days


know long gone
magics
might okay Im fine
Oh oh oh


Cause little town street
almost ran red cause lookin
Wind hair
remember well


Photo album counter cheeks turning red
used little kid glasses twinsized bed
mothers telling stories bout teeball team
tell bout past thinking future


know long gone
nothing else could
forget long enough
forget needed


Cause middle night
dancing round kitchen refrigerator light
stairs
remember well yeah


maybe got lost translation
Maybe asked much
maybe thing masterpiece
Til tore
Running scared
remember well
call
break like promise
casually cruel name honest
Im crumpled piece paper lying
Cause remember
well


Time wont fly like Im paralyzed
Id like old self Im still trying find
plaid shirt days nights made
mail back things walk home alone
keep old scarf first week
Cause reminds innocence smells like
cant get rid
Cause remember well yeah


Cause loved
Back lost one real thing youve ever known
rare
remember well


Wind hair
remember
stairs
remember
rare
remember well
