walked door air cold
something bout felt like home somehow
left scarf sisters house
youve still got drawer even
Oh sweet disposition wideeyed gaze
singing car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling like pieces place
picture days


know long gone
magics
might okay Im fine
Oh oh oh


Cause little town street
almost ran red cause lookin
Wind hair
remember well


Photo album counter cheeks turning red
used little kid glasses twinsized bed
mothers telling stories bout teeball team
taught bout past thinking future
tossing car keys fuck patriarchy
Key chain ground always skipping town
thinking drive time
Hes gonna say love never called
Til dead gone buried
Check pulse come back swearing
three months grave
wondered went reached
felt shame held lifeless frame


know long gone
nothing else could
forget long enough
forget needed


Cause middle night
dancing round kitchen refrigerator light
stairs
remember well
nobody know
kept like secret kept like oath
Sacred prayer wed swear
remember well yeah


Well maybe got lost translation
Maybe asked much
maybe thing masterpiece
Til tore
Running scared
remember well
call break like promise
casually cruel name honest
Im crumpled piece paper lying
Cause remember


say alls well ends well Im new Hell
Every time doublecross mind
said closer age maybe would fine
made want die
idea
neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects
weeping party bathroom
actress asking happened
Thats happened
charmed dad selfeffacing jokes
Sipping coffee like youre latenight show
watched watch front door night willing come
said supposed fun turning twentyone


Time wont fly like Im paralyzed
Id like old self Im still trying find
plaid shirt days nights made
mail back things walk home alone
keep old scarf first week
Cause reminds innocence smells like
cant get rid
Cause remember well yeah
Cause loved
Back lost one real thing youve ever known


rare
remember well
Wind hair
remember
stairs
remember
rare
remember well


never good telling jokes punch line goes
Ill get older lovers stay age
Brooklyn broke skin bones
Im soldier whos returning half weight
twin flame bruise paint blue
us love affair maim
Cause citys barren cold
still remember first fall snow
glistened fell
remember well


us love affair maim well

Wind hair

Sacred prayer
