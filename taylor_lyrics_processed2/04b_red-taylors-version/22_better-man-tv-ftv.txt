know Im probably better
lovin man didnt know
see permanent damage
Never wish could forget magic


wish wasnt standing mirror
Saying know
know bravest thing ever run


Sometimes middle night feel
miss wish better man
know say goodbye like back hand
miss wish better man
better man


know Im probably better alone
needing man could change mind
given minute
always terms
waited every careless word
Hoping might turn sweet
Like beginning

jealousy oh hear
Talking like Id always around
Push love away like kind loaded gun
Oh never thought Id run


Sometimes middle night feel
miss wish better man
know say goodbye like back hand
miss wish better man
better man


hold onto pride days
gave best know cant say
wish better man
wonder wouldve become
better man
might still love
better man
wouldve one
better man
Yeah yeah


Sometimes middle night feel
miss wish better man
know say goodbye like back hand
miss wish better man
better man

might still love better man

Yeah yeah
know say goodbye like back hand
miss wish better man
better man


might still love
better man
wouldve one
better man
