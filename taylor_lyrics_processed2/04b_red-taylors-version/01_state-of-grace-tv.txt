Im walkin fast traffic lights
Busy streets busy lives
know touch go
alone changin minds
fall love til hurts bleeds
fades time


never
Saw comin
Ill never





come around armor falls
Pierce room like cannonball
know dont let go
alone
room slates clean
twin fire signs four blue eyes


never saint
Ive loved shades wrong
learn live pain
Mosaic broken hearts
love brave wild


never
Saw comin
Ill never



state grace
worthwhile fight
Love ruthless game
Unless play good right
hands fate
Youre Achilles heel
golden age
something good right real


never
Saw comin
Ill never
yeah ohoh oh
never
Saw comin
Ill never



state grace
worthwhile fight
Love ruthless game
Unless play good right
