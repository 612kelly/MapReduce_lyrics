think Id say
scorpion sting fighting back
strike kill know

sing drive home
see face neighbors lawn
smile
mouth Fuck forever


Every time call crazy get crazy

say seem angry get angry


theres nothing like mad woman
shame went mad
one likes mad woman
made like
youll poke bear til claws come
find something wrap noose around
theres nothing like mad woman


breathe flames time talk
cannons firin yacht
say move know wont
women like hunting witches
dirtiest work
obvious wanting dead
really brought two together


Every time call crazy get crazy

say seem angry get angry


theres nothing like mad woman
shame went mad
one likes mad woman
made like
youll poke bear til claws come
find something wrap noose around
theres nothing like mad woman


Im taking time taking time
Cause took everything
Watching climb watching climb
people like
master spin couple side flings
Good wives always know
mad scathing like


one likes mad woman
shame went mad
made like
