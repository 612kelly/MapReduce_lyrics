Betty wont make assumptions
switched homeroom
think cause
Betty one time riding skateboard
passed house
like couldnt breathe


heard rumors Inez
cant believe word says
times time true
worst thing ever



showed party
Would Would want
Would tell go fuck
lead garden
garden would trust
told summer thing
Im seventeen dont know anything
know miss


Betty know went wrong
favorite song playing
far side gym
nowhere found
hate crowds know
Plus saw dance


heard rumors Inez
cant believe word says
times time true
worst thing ever



showed party
Would Would want
Would tell go fuck
lead garden
garden would trust
told summer thing
Im seventeen dont know anything
know miss


walking home broken cobblestones
thinking pulled like
figment worst intentions
said James get lets drive
days turned nights
Slept next
dreamt summer long


Betty Im doorstep
planned weeks
finally sinkin
Betty right last time
dream happens
see face


thing wanna
make
showed party
Yeah showed party


Yeah showed party
love
kiss porch
front stupid friends
kiss like dreamed
patch broken wings
Im seventeen dont know anything
know miss


Standing cardigan
Kissin car
Stopped streetlight
know miss
