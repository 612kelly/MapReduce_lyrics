Green color grass
used read Centennial Park
used think would meet somebody
Teal color shirt
sixteen yogurt shop
used work make little money


Time curious time
Gave compasses gave signs
clues didnt see
isnt pretty think
along
Invisible string
Tying
Oohoohoohooh


Bad blood song cab
first trip LA
ate favorite spot dinner
Bold waitress threeyear trip
Getting lunch Lakes
said looked like American singer


Time mystical time
Cutting open healing fine
clues didnt see
isnt pretty think
along
Invisible string
Tying
Oohoohoohooh


string pulled
wrong arms right dive bar
Something wrapped past mistakes barbed wire
Chains around demons
Wool brave seasons
One single thread gold
Tied


Cold steel axe grind
boys broke heart
send babies presents
Gold color leaves
showed around Centennial Park
Hell journey brought heaven


Time wondrous time
Gave blues purplepink skies
cool
Baby
isnt pretty think
along
Invisible string
Tying
Oohoohoohooh

Oohoohoohooh
