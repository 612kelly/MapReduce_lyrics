Vintage tee brand new phone
High heels cobblestones
young assume know nothing
Sequin smile black lipstick
Sensual politics
young assume know nothing


knew
Dancin Levis
Drunk streetlight
knew
Hand sweatshirt
Baby kiss better


felt like old cardigan
someones bed
put said favorite


friend friend none
Chase two girls lose one
young assume know nothing


knew
Playing hideandseek
Giving weekends
knew
heartbeat High Line
twenty lifetimes


felt like old cardigan
someones bed
put said favorite


kiss cars downtown bars
needed
drew stars around scars
Im bleedin


Cause knew
Steppin last train
Marked like bloodstain
knew
Tried change ending
Peter losing Wendy
knew
Leavin like father
Running like water
young assume know nothing


knew youd linger like tattoo kiss
knew youd haunt whatifs
smell smoke would hang around long
Cause knew everything young
knew Id curse longest time
Chasin shadows grocery line
knew youd miss thrill expired
youd standin front porch light
knew youd come back
Youd come back
youd come back
youd come back


felt like old cardigan
someones bed
put said favorite
