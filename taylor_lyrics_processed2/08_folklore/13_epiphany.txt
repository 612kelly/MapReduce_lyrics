Keep helmet keep life son
flesh wound heres rifle
Crawling beaches
Sir think hes bleeding
things cant speak


serve fall
Watch breathe watch breathing


Something med school cover
Someones daughter someones mother
Holds hand plastic
Doc think shes crashing
things cant speak


twenty minutes sleep
dream epiphany
one single glimpse relief
make sense youve seen


serve fall
Watch breathe watch breathing
serve fall
Watch breathe watch breathing


twenty minutes sleep
dream epiphany
one single glimpse relief
make sense youve seen
