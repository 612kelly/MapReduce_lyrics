Salt air rust door
never needed anything
Whispers sure
Never ever


see us lost memory
August slipped away moment time
Cause never mine
see us twisted bedsheets
August sipped away like bottle wine
Cause never mine


back beneath sun
Wishin could write name
call youre back school
remember thinkin


see us lost memory
August slipped away moment time
Cause never mine
see us twisted bedsheets
August sipped away like bottle wine
Cause never mine


Back still changin better
Wanting enough
enough
live hope
Cancel plans case youd call
say Meet behind mall
much summer love saying us
Cause werent mine lose
werent mine lose


see us lost memory
August slipped away moment time
Cause never mine
see us twisted bedsheets
August sipped away like bottle wine
Cause never mine


Cause never mine
Never mine
remember
Remember pulled said Get car
canceled plans case youd call
Back livin hope hope
Meet behind mall




Remember pulled said Get car
canceled plans case youd call
Back livin hope
hope hope
