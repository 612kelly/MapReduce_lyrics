Im good Im new shit
saying yes instead
thought saw bus stop didnt though
hit ground running night
hit Sunday matine
know greatest films time never made


guess never know never know
wanted really shouldve showed
never bleed youre never gonna grow
alright


something dont think
Roaring twenties tossing pennies pool
wishes came true
wouldve
defense none
never leaving well enough alone
wouldve fun
wouldve one



dream youre cool shit
adventures
meet woman internet take home
never painted numbers baby
making count
know greatest loves time


guess never know never know
another day waking alone


something dont think
Roaring twenties tossing pennies pool
wishes came true
wouldve
defense none
never leaving well enough alone
wouldve fun
wouldve one


persist resist temptation ask
one thing different
Would everything different today


something dont think
Ros flowing chosen family
wouldve sweet
couldve
defense none
digging grave another time
wouldve fun
wouldve one
