gather line weepin sunlit room
Im fire youll made ashes
Even worst day deserve babe
hell gave
Cause loved swear loved
Til dying day


didnt go grace
youre hero flying around saving face
Im dead wake
Cursing name wishing stayed
Look tears ricochet


gather stones never knowing theyll mean
throw make diamond ring
know didnt want haunt
ghostly scene
wear jewels gave
bury


didnt go grace
Cause Id fight used tell brave
Im dead wake
Cursing name wishing stayed
Look tears ricochet


go anywhere want
Anywhere want home
aim heart go blood
would still miss bones
still talk
cant sleep night


didnt go grace
battleships sink beneath waves
kill killed
Cursing name wishing stayed
turned worst fears
youre tossing blame drunk pain
Crossing good years
youre cursing name wishing stayed
Look tears ricochet
