Ive hard time adjusting
shiniest wheels theyre rusting
didnt know youd care came back
lot regrets
Pulled car road lookout
Couldve followed fears way
maybe dont quite know say
Im doorway


wanted know trying
wanted know trying


told cages mental
got wasted like potential
words shoot kill Im mad
lot regrets
ahead curve curve became sphere
Fell behind classmates ended
Pouring heart stranger
didnt pour whiskey


wanted know trying
wanted know trying


least Im trying


hard party feel like open wound
hard anywhere days want
Youre flashback film reel one screen town


wanted know trying

wanted know trying


least Im trying
