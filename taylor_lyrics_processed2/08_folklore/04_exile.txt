see standing honey
arms around body
Laughin jokes funny
took five whole minutes
pack us leave
Holdin love hall


think Ive seen film
didnt like ending
Youre homeland anymore
defending
town Im exile seein
think Ive seen film


Ooh ooh ooh


see starin honey
Like hes understudy
Like youd get knuckles bloody
Second third hundredth chances
Balancin breaking branches
eyes add insult injury


think Ive seen film
didnt like ending
Im problem anymore
offending
crown Im exile seein
think Ive seen film
Im leaving side door


step right amount
crying
time
always walked thin line
didnt even hear
never gave warning sign
time
never learned read mind
couldnt turn things around
Cause never gave warning sign
many signs many signs
didnt even see signs


think Ive seen film
didnt like ending
Youre homeland anymore
defending

think Ive seen film
Im leavin side door

step right amount
crying
time

couldnt turn things around
Cause never gave warning sign

couldnt turn things around
Cause never gave warning sign
