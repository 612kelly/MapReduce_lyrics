Make sure nobody sees leave
Hood head keep eyes
Tell friends youre run
Youll flushed return
Take road less traveled
Tell always stop
started beautiful rooms
Ends meetings parking lots


thats thing illicit affairs
clandestine meetings longing stares
born one single glance
dies dies dies
million little times


Leave perfume shelf
picked
leave trace behind
Like dont even exist
Take words
dwindling mercurial high
drug worked
first hundred times


thats thing illicit affairs
clandestine meetings stolen stares
show truth one single time
lie lie lie
million little times


wanna scream
Dont call kid dont call baby
Look godforsaken mess made
showed colors know cant see anyone else
Dont call kid dont call baby
Look idiotic fool made
taught secret language cant speak anyone else


know damn well
would ruin
million little times
