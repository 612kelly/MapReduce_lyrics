one
smoking gun
eclipsed sun
broken
twisted knife
sleepless night
winless fight
frozen ground


Stood cliffside screaming Give reason
faithless loves hoax believe
Dont want shade blue
sadness world would


best laid plan
sleight hand
barren land
ash fire


Stood cliffside screaming Give reason
faithless loves hoax believe
Dont want shade blue
sadness world would


know left part back New York
knew hero died whats movie
knew still hurts underneath scars
pulled apart
knew password let door
knew whats point keeping score
knew still hurts underneath scars
pulled apart
dark

Darling hard
pulled apart


one
kingdom come undone
broken drum
beaten heart
Dont want shade blue
sadness world would
