comingofage come gone
Suddenly summer clear
never courage convictions
long danger near
around corner darlin
Cause lives
could never give peace


Im fire Ill keep brittle heart warm
cascade ocean wave blues come
people think loves show
would die secret
devils details got friend
Would enough could never give peace


integrity makes seem small
paint dreamscapes wall
talk shit friends like Im wasting honor
know Id swing fences
Sit trenches
Give wild give child
Give silence comes two people understand
Family chose see brother brother
enough
theres robbers east clowns west
Id give sunshine give best
rain always gonna come youre standin


Im fire Ill keep brittle heart warm
cascade ocean wave blues come
people think loves show
would die secret
devils details got friend
Would enough could never give peace
Would enough could never give peace
Would enough could never give peace
