Please picture trees
hit peak seven
Feet swing creek
scared jump
high sky
Pennsylvania
still beautiful things


Sweet tea summer
Cross heart wont tell
though cant recall face
still got love
braids like pattern
Love Moon Saturn
Passed like folk songs
love lasts long


Ive meaning tell
think house haunted
dad always mad must
think come live
pirates
wont cry
hide closet
like folk song
love passed


Please picture weeds
learned civility
used scream ferociously
time wanted



Sweet tea summer
Cross heart wont tell
though cant recall face
still got love
Pack dolls sweater
Well move India forever
Passed like folk songs
love lasts long
