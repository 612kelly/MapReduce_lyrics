Follow home dare
wouldnt know lead
take chances one took chances
watch dark wait life start
beauty memory


wanted wanted
young wander London streets alone haunted
Born nothing
least something something cling
Visions dazzling rooms Ill never get let
memories lost long ago
least beautiful ghosts


Perilous night voices calling
flicker light dawning
wild ones taming fear within
Scared call friends broken
hope mystical dream


wanted wanted
young wander London streets alone haunted
Born nothing
least something something cling
Visions dazzling rooms Ill never get let
memories lost long ago
least beautiful ghosts


maybe home isnt known
thought would
feel alive phantoms night
know life isnt safe wild free


wanted wanted
Ill never wander London streets alone haunted
Born nothing
something something cling
never knew Id love world theyve let
memories lost long ago
Ill dance beautiful ghosts
memories lost long ago
Ill dance beautiful ghosts
