Everybodys waiting
Everybodys watching
Even youre sleeping
Keep eyes open


tricky thing
yesterday children
Playing soldiers pretending
Dreaming dreams happy endings
backyards
Winnin battles wooden swords
weve stepped cruel world
everybody stands keeps score





Everybodys waitin break
Everybodys watchin see fallout
Even youre sleepin sleepin
Keep eyes open


Keep eyes open
Keep eyes open



Two steps ahead stayin guard
Every lesson forms new scar
never thought youd make far
turn around
Oh theyve surrounded showdown
nobody comes save
got somethin dont
Yeah got somethin dont


gotta keep eyes open
See Taylor Swift Live
Get tickets low


Everybodys waitin break
Everybodys watchin see fallout
Even youre sleepin sleepin
Keep eyes open


Keep eyes open
Keep eyes


Keep feet ready heartbeat steady
Keep eyes open
Keep aim locked night goes dark
Keep eyes open






Everybodys waitin break
Everybodys watchin see fallout
Even youre sleepin sleepin
Keep eyes open


Keep eyes open
Keep eyes open
Keep eyes open
Keep eyes open
