Id never gone wind
let flow
Let take wants go
Til open door
Theres much
Id never seen
trying fly
couldnt find wings
came along changed everything


lift feet ground
spin around
make crazier crazier
Feels like Im falling lost eyes
make crazier crazier crazier


Ive watched distance made life
Every sky kind blue
wanted know would feel
made real
showed something couldnt see
opened eyes
made believe


lift feet ground
spin around
make crazier crazier
Feels like Im falling lost eyes
make crazier crazier crazier oh


Baby showed living
dont want hide anymore
Oh oh


lift feet ground
spin around
make crazier crazier
Feels like Im falling lost eyes
make crazier crazier crazier
Crazier crazier
