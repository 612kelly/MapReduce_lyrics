Everybodys waiting
Everybodys watching
Even youre sleeping
Keep eyeyes open


tricky thing
yesterday children
Playing soldiers
pretending
Dreaming dreams happy endings
backyards winning battles wooden swords
weve stepped cruel world
everybody stands keeps score
Keep eyes open


Everybodys waiting break
Everybodys watching see fallout
Even youre sleeping sleeping
Keep eyeyes open
Keep eyeyes open
Keep eyeyes open


two steps ahead staying guard
Every lesson forms new scar
never thought youd make far
turn around
Oh theyve surrounded
showdown
nobody comes save
youve got something dont
Yeah youve got something dont
Youve got keep eyes open


Everybodys waiting break
Everybodys watching see fallout
Even youre sleeping sleeping
Keep eyeyes open
Keep eyeyes open
Keep eyeyes


Keep feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep eyes open
Keep aim locked
night goes dark
Keep eyes open

Keep eyes open
Keep eyes open
Keep eyes open


Everybodys waiting break
Everybodys watching see fallout
Even youre sleeping sleeping


Keep eyeyes open
Keep eyeyes open
Keep eyeyes open
Keep eyeyes open
Keep eyeyes open
