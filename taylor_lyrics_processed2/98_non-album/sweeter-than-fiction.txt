Hit ground hit ground hit ground
sound sound hear
never saw coming
Slipped started running
youve come undone
Seen fall seen crawl knees
Seen lost crowd seen colors fade
Wish could make better
Someday wont remember
pain thought would last forever ever


stand ten feet tall
say knew along
eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction


shot shot dark
got got shattered hopes
never saw coming
hit ground running
youre something
say
sight sight light came
Proved right proved right proved wrong
perfect weather
like dont remember
rain thought would last forever ever


stand ten feet tall
say knew along
eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction
stand next
rest history
eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction fiction


Ill one many saying
Look look
Ill one many saying
made us proud made us proud proud
Ill one many saying
Look look
Ill one many saying
made us proud made us proud proud
call name
put picture frame
know Ill time
Cause loved
hit ground hit ground hit ground oh oh
sound sound heard
perfect weather
like dont remember
rain thought would last forever ever


stand ten feet tall
say knew along
eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction
stand next
rest history
eyes wider distance
life sweeter fiction fiction
