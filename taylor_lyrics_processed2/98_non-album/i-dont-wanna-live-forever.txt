sitting eyes wide open behind four walls hoping youd call
cruel existence like point hoping


Baby baby feel crazy
night night every day
Give something oh say nothing
happening


dont wanna live forever cause know Ill living vain
dont wanna fit wherever
wanna keep calling name come back home
wanna keep calling name come back home
wanna keep calling name come back home


Im sitting eyes wide open got one thing stuck mind
Wondering dodged bullet lost love life


Baby baby feel crazy
night night every day
gave something gave nothing
happening


dont wanna live forever cause know Ill living vain
dont wanna fit wherever
wanna keep calling name come back home
wanna keep calling name come back home
wanna keep calling name come back home


Ive looking sad nicest places
Baby baby feel crazy
see around empty faces
night night every day
Ive looking sad nicest places
Give something oh say nothing
Im cab tell em place
happening


dont wanna live forever cause know Ill living vain
dont wanna fit wherever
wanna keep calling name come back home
wanna keep calling name come back home
wanna keep calling name come back home
wanna keep calling name come back home
wanna keep calling name come back home


wanna keep calling name come back home
come back home
