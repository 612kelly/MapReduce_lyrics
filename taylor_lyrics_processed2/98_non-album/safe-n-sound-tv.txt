remember tears streaming face said Ill never let go
shadows almost killed light
remember said Dont leave alone
thats dead gone passed tonight


close eyes
sun going
Youll alright
one hurt
Come morning light
Ill safe sound


Dont dare look window darlin everythings fire
war outside door keeps ragin
Hold lullaby
Even th musics gone gone


close yes
sun going
Youll alright
one hurt
Come morning light
Ill safe sound


Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Oh
Oh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Oh
Oh


close eyes
Youll alright
Come morning light
Ill safe sound


Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
Ooh ooh
