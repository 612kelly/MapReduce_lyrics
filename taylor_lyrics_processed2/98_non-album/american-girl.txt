Well American girl
Raised promises
couldnt help thinking little life
Somewhere else

great big world
lots places run
die trying
one little promise going keep


Oh yeah right
Take easy baby
Make last night
American girl


Well kind cold night
stood alone balcony
could see cars roll

Like waves crashing beach

one desperate moment
crept back memory
God painful
something thats close still far reach

Oh yeah right
Take easy baby
Make last night
American girl


Oh yeah right
Take easy baby
Make last night
Oh yeah right
Take easy baby
Oh take easy


Oh yeah right
American girl
