Youre screaming inside frozen time

game rigged ref got tricked
wrong ones think theyre right
outnumbered time

run run run


every day

Wondering best hiding spot would
big bad man big bad clan
hands stained red
Oh quickly forget

busy helping
arent gonna change
gotta

one thing save us

Dont say youre tired fight
matter time
theres finish line
Dont say youre tired fight
matter time
theres finish line
