Last night heard heart beatin
Sounded like footsteps stairs
Six months gone Im still reachin
Even though know youre
playin back thousand memories baby
Thinkin bout everything weve
Maybe Ive going back much lately
time stood still


Come back come back come back like
would would movie
Stand rain outside til came
Come back come back come back like
could could said youre sorry
know could work somehow
movie youd


know people change things happen
remember back
Wrapped arms friends laughin
Cause nothing like ever happened
Im pacing hall chasing street
Flashback night said
Nothings gonna change
Back knew much lose


Come back come back come back like
would would movie
Stand rain outside til came
Come back come back come back like
could could said youre sorry
know could work somehow
movie youd


youre youre somewhere youre moving
Ive waiting every day since youve gone
want back way
wanna see back front door


say Come back come back come back like
would said easy
fight locked
take back


Come back come back come back like
would would movie
Stand rain outside til came
Come back come back come back like
could could said youre sorry
know could work somehow
movie youd


Youd
kind ending wanna see
Baby ending
Oh thought youd
Oh oh
Thought youd
