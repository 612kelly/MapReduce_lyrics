could leave Christmas lights til January
place make rules
theres dazzling haze mysterious way dear
known seconds years

Forever ever ah
Take take home

could light bunch candles
dance around kitchen baby
Pictures young would hang wall
would sit stoop
Ill sing love songs eighty
See finally got honey wont let fall

always close
Forever ever ah
Take take home
Youre lover


Ladies gentlemen please stand
every guitar string scar hand
take magnetic force man lover
Look eyes tell truth

Forever ever ah
Take take home
