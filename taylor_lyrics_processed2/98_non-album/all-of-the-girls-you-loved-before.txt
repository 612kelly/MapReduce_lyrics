think late nights
Lame fights phone
Wake mornin someone
feelin alone


heart drawn around name
someones handwriting mine
sneakin town
Holdin hands killin time


past mine parallel lines
Stars aligned intertwined
taught
way call baby
Treat like lady
say


girls loved
Made one Ive fallen
Every deadend street led straight
youre need Im thankful
girls loved
love


think makeup
Fake love town
Cryin bathroom dude
Whose name cannot remember


Secret jokes alone
ones home sixteen wild
breakin makin
Leave without sayin goodbye


know
everything made
call baby
Thats youre amazing


girls loved
Made one Ive fallen
Every deadend street led straight
youre need Im thankful
girls loved
love


mother brought loyal kind
Teenage love taught theres good goodbye
Every woman knew brought
wanna teach forever feels like


girls loved
Made one Ive fallen
Every deadend street led straight
youre need Im thankful
girls loved
love
