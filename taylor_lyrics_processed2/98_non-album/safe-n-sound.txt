remember tears streaming face
said Ill never let go
shadows almost killed light
remember said Dont leave alone
thats dead gone passed tonight


close eyes
sun going
Youll alright
one hurt
Come morning light
Ill safe sound


Dont dare look window
Darling everythings fire
war outside door keeps raging
Hold lullaby
Even musics gone
Gone


close eyes
sun going
Youll alright
one hurt
Come morning light
Ill safe sound


Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh


close eyes
Youll alright
Come morning light
Ill safe sound


Ooh ooh ooh ooh oh oh
