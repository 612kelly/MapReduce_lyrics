Oh Carolina creeks running veins
Lost born lonesome came
Lonesome Ill always stay
Carolina knows years roam
Free birds light whispers
Carolina knows


didnt see
never see
shes dreams


mist clouds
Dont leave
make fist Ill make count
places never ever go
things Carolina ever know


Carolina stains dress left
Indelible scars pivotal marks
Blue life fled
Carolina pines wont cover
Hide like robes back road
Muddy webs weave


didnt see
Oh never see
shes dreams


mist clouds
Dont leave
make fist Ill make count
places never ever go
things Carolina ever know


didnt see
never see
didnt see
never saw


Oh Carolina knows years theyve said
guilty sin sleep liars bed
sleep comes fast Ill meet ghosts
sand sea
Carolina knows
