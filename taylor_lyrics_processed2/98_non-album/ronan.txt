remember bare feet hallway
remember little laugh
Race cars kitchen floor plastic dinosaurs
love moon back
remember blue eyes looking mine
Like secret club
remember dancing bed time
jumping waking
still feel hold hand little man
even moment knew
fought hard like army guy
Remember leaned whispered


Come baby going fly away
best four years


remember drive home
blind hope turned crying screaming
Flowers pile worst way one knows say
beautiful boy died
Halloween
could anything wanted still
remember last day kissed face
whispered ear


Come baby going fly away
curtain room hospital grey well disappear
Come baby going fly away
best four years


Im standing closet trying talk
kept handmedowns wont grow
really thought miracle would see us
miracle even getting one moment


Come baby going fly away
Come baby going fly away
best four years


remember bare feet hallway
love moon back
