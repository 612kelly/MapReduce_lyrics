said way blue eyes shined
Put Georgia stars shame night
said Thats lie
boy Chevy truck
tendency gettin stuck
backroads night
right beside summer long
time woke find summer gone


think Tim McGraw
hope think favorite song
one danced night long
moon like spotlight lake
think happiness
hope think little black dress
Think head chest
old faded blue jeans
think Tim McGraw
hope think


September saw month tears
thankin God werent
see like
box beneath bed
letter never read
three summers back
hard find little bittersweet
lookin back nice believe


think Tim McGraw
hope think favorite song
one danced night long
moon like spotlight lake
think happiness
hope think little black dress
Think head chest
old faded blue jeans
think Tim McGraw
hope think


Im back first time since
Im standin street
theres letter left doorstep
first thing youll read
think Tim McGraw
hope think favorite song
Someday youll turn radio
hope takes back place


think happiness
hope think little black dress
Think head chest
old faded blue jeans
think Tim McGraw
hope think
Oh think
Mmmm


said way blue eyes shine
Put Georgia stars shame night
said Thats lie
