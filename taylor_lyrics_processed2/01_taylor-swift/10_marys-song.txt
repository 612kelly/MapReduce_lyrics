said seven nine
looked like stars shined
sky pretty lights
daddies used joke two us
Growing falling love mamas smiled
rolled eyes said Oh


Take back house backyard tree
Said youd beat bigger
never never
Take back world one block wide
dared kiss ran tried
two kids
Oh


Well sixteen suddenly
wasnt little girl used see
eyes still shined like pretty lights
daddies used joke two us
never believed wed really fall love
mamas smiled rolled eyes
said Oh


Take back creek beds turned
Two riding truck need next
Take back time first fight
slamming doors instead kissing goodnight
stayed outside til morning light
Oh


years gone come around
sitting favorite spot town
looked got one knee


Take back time walked aisle
whole town came mamas cried
said
Take home met many years
Well rock babies front porch

Ill still look like stars shine
