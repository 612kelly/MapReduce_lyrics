Seems one doesnt see beauty
face mirror looking back
walk around thinking youre pretty
thats true cause know


Hold baby youre losing
waters high youre jumping
letting go one knows
cry dont tell anyone
might golden one
youre tied together smile
youre coming undone


guess true love wanted
Cause youre giving away like extra change
Hoping end pocket
leaves like penny rain
Oh cause price pay
price pay


Hold baby youre losing
waters high youre jumping
letting go one knows
cry dont tell anyone
might golden one
youre tied together smile
youre coming undone
Oh oohoh


Hold baby youre losing
waters high youre jumping
letting go one knows
cry dont tell anyone
might golden one
youre tied together smile
youre coming undone


Youre tied together smile
youre coming undone oh
Goodbye baby
smile baby baby
