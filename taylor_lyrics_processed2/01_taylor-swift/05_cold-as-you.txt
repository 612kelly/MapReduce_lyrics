way coming easily
take take best
start fight cause need feel something
want cause Im wanted


Oh shame rainy ending given perfect day
walk away aint use defending words never say
Im sitting thinking
Ive never anywhere cold


put walls paint shade gray
stood loving wished away
come away great little story
mess dreamer nerve adore


Oh shame rainy ending given perfect day
walk away aint use defending words never say
Im sitting thinking
Ive never anywhere cold


never give damn thing honey cried cried
know wouldnt told nobody died died



Oh shame rainy ending given perfect day
Every smile fake condescending
Counting scars made
Im sitting thinking
Ive never anywhere cold
