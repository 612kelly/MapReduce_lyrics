Hes got onehand feel steering wheel

song slamming screen door
Sneakin late tapping window
phone talk real slow
Cause late mama dont know

first date Man didnt kiss
got home fore said amen
Asking God could play


walking front porch steps
everything day
gone wrong trampled
lost thrown away
Got hallway well way
lovin bed
almost didnt notice roses
note said


song slamming screen door
Sneakin late tapping window
phone talk real slow
Cause late mama dont know
song way laugh
first date Man didnt kiss
got home fore said amen
Asking God could play
Dadadada


Ive heard every album listened radio
Waited somethin come along

Cause song slamming screen door
Sneakin late tappin window
phone talks real slow
Cause late mama dont know
song way laughs
first date Man didnt kiss
got home fore said amen
Asking God could play
Play oh yeah
Oh oh yeah


ridin shotgun hair undone
front seat car
grabbed pen old napkin
